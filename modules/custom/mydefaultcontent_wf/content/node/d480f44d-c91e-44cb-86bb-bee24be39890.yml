        In 2017, the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace launched its report “A Matter of Survival” with recommendations on how to promote water as an instrument for cooperation and peace, including through innovative financing for water cooperation. At the 9th session (2021) of the Meeting of the Parties to the 1992 Water Convention, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched the publication on Funding and Financing transboundary water cooperation and basin development, also presenting innovative Financing Initiatives, including the Blue Peace Financing Initiative.  Co-created by Basin Organisations, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) as the main implementing agency and other stakeholders, the Blue Peace Financing Initiative combines public and private finance to develop and implement transboundary master- and joint investment plans. It will promote access to public and private capital for Transboundary Organizations (e.g. River Basin Organizations (RBOs)). The main objective of this High-Level Panel (HLP) will be to launch the Blue Peace Financing Initiative, showing how innovative financing mechanisms can transform water into an instrument for transboundary, multi-sectoral and inter-generational cooperation frameworks, leading to peaceful societies and circular economies. 
        Outcomes: It will provide a new financial incentive for countries and sectors to cooperate and establish political agreements on the sustainable management of shared resources, reducing social, political, economic and environmental risks and conflicts. Meanwhile, it will change the financial sector’s perception of water, not as a distinct sector, but as an entry-point for multi-sectoral and regional impact investment opportunities.
