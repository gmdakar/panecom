        Greater frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, unpredictable rainfall patterns… Water is the first victim of climate change, and our societies are collateral victims. As climate change impacts increase, a massive financial effort is required to improve water resources management, develop (green and grey) water infrastructures and boost adaptation.

        Yet, in the portfolio of projects supported by climate finance actors, water is not well represented, lagging far behind the sectors of energy, agriculture or forestry. Part of the problem still is a lack of awareness from donors that adaptation of these sectors (cooling power plants, irrigating crops, limiting deforestation and desertification) requires water. And maintaining a strong communication and advocacy effort is part of the solution. 

        But the heart of the problem seems to lie both in the complexity of the climate finance landscape and in the limited capacities of water stakeholders to achieve a cycle of climate project preparation and to access donors’ preparation facilities. 

        There is a necessity to build their capacities to prepare well-designed, bankable climate resilient water projects that will attract funding from the wide range of private and public donors of climate finance!
