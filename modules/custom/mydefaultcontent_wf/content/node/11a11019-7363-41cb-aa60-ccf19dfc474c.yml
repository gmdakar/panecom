        The private sector is a major player in driving innovation and developing demand-driven knowledge-based solutions in the water and sanitation sector. German companies within the water and sanitation sector have recognized that the key factors which ensure their long-term viability and sustainability of investments are employees with exactly the right qualifications as well as sector-specific knowledge and skills. For this reason, the private sector is continuously investing in training young people. Access to technical education in the water and sanitation sector provides important leverage for improving and securing the quality of water supply and wastewater disposal in a sustainable way. By portraying innovative water and sanitation technologies and linking them to best practices in education and capacity development, the session contributes to the WWF’s major thematic focuses, especially in the action group on “increasing water efficiency and sustainable management through science, technology, innovation and education”.

        Expected results
        - Providing an overview of the German private sector role in developing demand-driven innovative solutions in the water and sanitation sector and portraying some of the latest innovative technologies
        - Showing best practices and current programs in education and vocational training as these are critical success factors for a future-oriented development of sustainable water and sanitation management. This will be done by portraying the activities of different stakeholders such as the private sector, government bodies and educational institutes 
        - Strengthening European-African cooperation in the field of vocational education and training in the water and sanitation sector.
