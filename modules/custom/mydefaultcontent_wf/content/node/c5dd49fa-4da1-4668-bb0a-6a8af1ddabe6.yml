        The long-time partnership between GWP and AfWA has been particularly
        deepened through the implementation of our joint project, the German African
        Partnership for Water and Sanitation (GAPWAS), in 2019.
        Through a knowledge transfer between German and African experts and the
        presentation of innovative technologies, this session aims at identifying solution
        strategies that can contribute to better management of storm water events in
        West Africa.
        With climate change, the challenge of storm water management has become a
        global one that will grow and increasingly affect both of our continents in the
        coming years. Therefore, the networking and exchange of experience between
        German and African experts from the water and sanitation sector as well as civil
        society organizations and political decision-makers will lay the foundation for
        sustainable and long-term cooperation in the field of storm water management.
        By involving local authorities, the political importance of storm water
        management will be communicated, with the goal to support effective
        prevention and control of flood damage in West Africa by corresponding political
        agendas.
