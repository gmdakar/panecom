      value: 'Water is an essential constituent for humans, and for life. Polluted water is often identified as the main vector to infectious pathogens, toxins and organic contaminants, which can be associated with a large number of chronic diseases worldwide. In the past decades, growth of human population and human activities have not only increased the quantity of waste discharged into water bodies, but also introduced emerging substances, including pollutants of industrial source, pharmaceuticals or micro plastics.

      value: 'The objective of this session focusing on water pollutions, including industrial pollutants and Contaminants of Emerging Concerns, is to provide existing solutions and case studies on how to address the issue of water pollution, and to raise awareness about new kinds of pollutants which are not yet taken -or barely- into account in regulations, laws and water treatments. This session will be a useful way to gather knowledge on how to identify, monitor, and tackle some specific sources of pollutants, as well as better understand the issue of emerging contaminants. '
