        The 4th Mediterranean Water Forum, held in Malta in December 2021, was a platform for exchanging and consolidating know-how and experiences in the field of water in the Mediterranean. It identified effective responses to ensure water security. This theme is of crucial importance for the Mediterranean where demographic changes, socio-economic challenges and the effects of climate change are constantly threatening water security. The Mediterranean process will attempt.
        Based on the exchange of experiences during the Malta forum, best practices and technologies developed were identified to be presented as answers to the challenges related to water security in the region and beyond including
        a) Water solutions inspired by regenerative nature with innovative operating models. 
        b) A water efficiency monitoring tool, providing an audit and improvement of the hydraulic performance of water supply systems
        c) Reconciliation of industrial growth with the preservation of water resources through the implementation of a "Circular Economy" program based on a strategy of optimizing consumption and the use of non-conventional waters 
        d) Methodological guide for a technical assistance approach to perimeters irrigated by treated wastewater
        e) World Observatory of non-conventional water resources and associated renewable energies whose aim is to complement the work of institutions by bringing research and application experiences to a wider audience.
