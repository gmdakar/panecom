        "Access to information on the state and evolution of water resources and their uses is an imperative need and a major challenge to establish an inclusive governance framework that takes into account in a structured manner the different links of integrated water management.

        In view of the crucial importance of data, good governance of water resources therefore requires a strengthening of capacities to access and process water data in collaboration with local stakeholders, in order to generate information and services that meet the requirements of inclusive planning.
