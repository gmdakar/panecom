        The extensive analysis of gender-related achievements and challenges in the water domain carried out by the Water and Gender working Group led by UNESCO WWAP clearly suggests that - despite advances at international policy-level - progress in the fulfilment of the basic right of gender equality in water and sanitation is not on track. Women remain underrepresented with respect to employment and participation to decision-making at all levels in the water domain. Eight years to the end-date of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, bold and ambitious concrete action is urgently needed.

        Unlocking progress towards gender equality in water needs solid knowledge, practical solutions, and collaborative action. UNESCO WWAP together with a Multi-stakeholder Coalition, which includes Member States’ institutions, international and regional organizations, academia and NGOs, is leading a global Call for Action for accelerating progress towards gender equality in the water domain and building just and resilient societies. 

        This special session presents the efforts on the ground to reach the common goal and to close the data gap in the water sector in pursuit of gender equality. Mobilised by the Call for Action Initiative, a number of organizations and experts will discuss strategies and good practices in overcoming persistent gender-related challenges in water. Similarly, the session will explore how decision makers in different global regions are addressing gender inequalities in water governance and in adaptive integrated water management, as well as share knowledge on approaches to increase the resilience and inclusion of community members.
