      value: 'USAID’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) program has been implemented since 2016 with the objective of closing financing gaps to achieve universal access to water and sanitation services through sustainable and creditworthy business models, increased public funding, and expanded market finance for infrastructure investment. The program has so far helped raise over USD 68.4 million in 8 countries in Africa and Asia, showing that it is possible to leverage private financing to the sector. However, USD 68 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the USD 114 billion per year that is estimated to be needed to bridge the sector financing gap. Using examples from the Philippines, Cambodia, and Kenya, this session will frame the WASH finance gap as a governance challenge focusing on the lack of clarity in sector actor roles and responsibilities, particularly within sectors undergoing decentralization/devolution processes. Using examples from Senegal, Mozambique and South Africa, the session will also showcase how technical assistance programs like WASH-FIN can help address water sector governance challenges to enable both the framework and financing mechanisms needed to crowd-in new sources of financing for both public and private WASH service providers. This interactive session is targeted at WASH practitioners managing and regulating water utilities, government decision makers, financiers, and academics.  By the end of the session, participants will have developed an appreciation of key sector governance challenges and how they may be addressed to enable increased access to non-traditional financing to public and private WASH service providers.'
