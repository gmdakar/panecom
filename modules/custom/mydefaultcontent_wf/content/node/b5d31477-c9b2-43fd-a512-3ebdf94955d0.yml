        Objectives of the Session:
        To establish a dynamic exchange of experiences between three transboundary aquifer management treaties on three continents: firstly the major developments on governance in the last two years on the Senegal-Mauritania aquifer in Africa secondly the 40 years experience of the Genevois aquifer between France and Switzerland in Europe, and finally the developments of the Guarani aquifer in South America. The session will bring together representatives from the three basins on these aquifers to exchange experiences, lessons learned, relevant committees and other institutional arrangements, data sharing, stakeholder participation and peace building opportunities. It is expected that this session will mark the beginning of a longer term collaboration between these three different transboundary aquifer treaties.
        This session will have a particular focus on the BASM which has had major developments in the last two years and in particular to join surface water and groundwater governance.
