        The panel seeks to address the need to include adaptation to climate change in the formulation of public policies and strategies by governments and water and sewage operating companies.
        The resilience of water supply systems play a fundamental role in the strategic planning of those responsible for the sanitation sector to permanently serve the various water users, especially the supply for inhabitants of urban and rural areas where the resources are no longer available in abundance
        The water and sanitation sector plays an important role in reducing the impact of human activity on the environment, a characteristic that should be better exploited to enable the sector's development, for example, transforming the generation of waste and the sewage into new resources, and enabling cleaner rivers and water bodies. In adition, how to serve thousands of people who live in irregular settlements and end up polluting rivers and water supply sources? Many water and sewage operating companies have been implementing unconventional measures to help adresss the problem.
        Therefore, Adaptation, Risk mitigation, Redundance, Reuse and Safe Environment are topics approached by major water and sewage operators worldwide nowadays and this panel will allow, theexchange of experiences, the opportunity to share strategies, methods, and practices by several sanitation companies.
        Thus, the aim is, in a global way, to reflect on changes in the way in which governments and providers of basic sanitation services act and mainly help decision makers and public authorities to implement public policies concerning the approached topics.
