      value: 'Implementation of Integrated water resources management - a process connecting environment preservation and improvement of social and economic conditions of communities at all levels - requests to relay on sciences based knowledge and information. Information plays a key role to involve local stakeholders in participative approach , and also at national level to take decision. Information and Communication technologies, Remote sensing, water monitoring of watersheds, networking bringing scientific outcomes to stakeholders, toolbox…. All these are crucial to improve and strengthen IWRM at all levels. Various projects of implemented studies will be shared in two parts in the frame of this session, one dedicated to Stakeholders inclusion to IWRM at all levels, and the second one from international network on hydrology to technical information as well as from remote sensing to modeling and forecasting. Solutions are implemented in various countries around the world, the panelists come from NGOs, INGs, Ministry, Water Agency and academic institutions.v'
