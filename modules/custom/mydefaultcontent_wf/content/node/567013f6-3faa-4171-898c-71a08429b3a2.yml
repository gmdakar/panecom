        Rural maldevelopment, rising climate problems, degradation of natural resources, water, food and socio-political insecurity... The 2020-2030 decade will be decisive (MDGs, climate action...). We need to change our way of thinking, we need to build differently.
        Building differently means moving from not doing (neglecting the rural world) or "doing" (top-down, silo-based, technocratic actions and policies) to "doing with": with people, with nature and with territories. 
        Providing answers that meet the challenges requires more living soil, more agronomy, more water and more mobilization and investment. These are central issues, political in the noble sense of the term, which require new long-term visions, systemic analyses and territorialized approaches. 
        The special session follows two international meetings "on the road to Dakar", organized in October 2021 (7th edition of the seminar on water and food security in West Africa and the Mediterranean -SESAME- and the Parmenides Conference of Bari on the management of watersheds in the Mediterranean). Based on their conclusions, it aims to :
        - to highlight the elements of long-term vision and, through concrete examples, the possible contents and scope of "building differently
        - to propose the elements of policies implementing the levers of a transition at different territorial scales,
        - to bring out political messages that will contribute to the success of the Forum and its high-level panels.
