      value: 'The session aims first to address the Water-Peace-Security nexus in the West and Central African context. Also, it aims to present the main achievements of the DEP initiative since its official launch in 2019; the session will serve as an opportunity to exchange on the main future strategic orientations of the DEP in terms of think tank on the water-peace-development nexus. To this end, the session will aim to explore the possibilities of setting up the follow-up mechanism of the WEF recommendations in concert with the Dakar Water Forum Secretariat.'
