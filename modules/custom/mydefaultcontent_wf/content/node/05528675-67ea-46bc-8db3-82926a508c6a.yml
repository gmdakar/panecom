        Conversations on water issues are often dominated by water sector, water experts and specialised civil society organisations. Our session aims to change this.  We need to hear new voices.  With young leaders emerging all over of the planet in business, media, technology, civil society, and governments, if they turn their leadership to water, it would be a powerful way of approaching, understanding problem and addressing causes of inequalities. We want to help the water community by bring in new leaders in an exciting way.  The session will bring together key Water leaders with the ability to influence significant change with youth organisation and leaders and civil society organisations. An alliance of today’s and tomorrow’s leaders will create a breakthrough, catalyzed by the World Water Forum in Dakar.
