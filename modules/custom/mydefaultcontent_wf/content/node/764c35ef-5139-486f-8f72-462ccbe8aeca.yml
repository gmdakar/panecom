        Water, sanitation and hygiene are at the heart of the balances of ecosystems and societies, an essential factor of biodiversity, food security, health and peace. Public Development Banks have in many contexts proven they can have a catalyst role, not only to finance water and sanitation investments but also to enhance cooperation. This session will be an opportunity to explore their unique mandate and see how  they can help bridging the funding gap towards sound WASH investments and achieving SDG6.

        I – Assessment – How far are we from effectively financing the water and sanitation sector? 20 min
        GLAAS & TrackFin – 10 min Didier Allely

        Effective financing for drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is essential to deliver and sustain services. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) results indicate that there are substantial gaps in our understanding and tracking of financing to the WASH sector. Financial reporting is often insufficient to make sound and evidence-based planning and budgeting decisions. To help address the issue, WHO is supporting national government to develop WASH accounts using the TrackFin methodology under the UN-Water GLAAS project. GLAAS reports assess data from several different sources, including global data on sanitation and drinking-water coverage, donor aid flows, economic and development indicators, health indicator data, and data from regional sector and multi-sector assessments. GLAAS gathers data at both recipient country and external support agency level to fill key knowledge gaps 
        Objectives:
        •	Highlight current financial information at the national level from GLAAS and WASH accounts implementing countries
        •	Highlight results from the External Support Agency survey
        •	 10 min discussion with the audience
        II – Of the need for more engagement: PDBs leveraging private and public stakeholders – 30 min 
        •	AFD Céline Robert – Co Chair of the Water Finance Coalition – 15 min
        Introduce the rationale of the Water Finance Coalition and the necessity for PBDs to engage and work on those challenges, as well as how PDBs can help leveraging both private and public stakeholders. 
        + Take aways from the global study on PDBs : Some constraints have to be addressed for NDBs to succeed in financing water and sanitation: demand and offer of financing do not meet spontaneously. National Development Banks need specific financial tools (such as project preparation funds) and dedicated skills/expertise to be able to invest in the wash sector.

        CAF (Franz Rojas) – PDBs as a way to leverage private and public stakeholders (10min)

        5 min discussion with the audience
        III – Of the complementarity of tools: PDBs as a catalyser – 40 min
        How PBDs can strengthen stakeholders’ governance and capacities to catalyse investments with patient investments, a variety of financial tools, and soft support
        •	Case Study Blue credit line, Morroco – EIB – 10 min Emmanuel Chaponniere
        •	Case Study– BOAD – Serge EKUE 10 min
        •	Case Study BAfD – 10 min Ousseynou Guene
