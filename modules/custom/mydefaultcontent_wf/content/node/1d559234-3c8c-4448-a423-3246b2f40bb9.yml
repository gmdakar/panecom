        The session cuts across priority 1: Water security and Sanitation (human rights to water and sanitation) and priority 3: Cooperation (strengthen dialogue and partnerships…)

        The session intends to fit within the following themes:
        human rights access to watsan, access for all, relations between ethics and water & sanitation services and interfaith collaboration/dialogue.

        Objectives

        •	Show the connections between faith, religious, spiritual values and water, sanitation and hygiene.
        •	Call to increased interfaith dialogue in educating and engaging on water security issues.
        •	Underscore that religious values and traditions can be a motivation for commitment, solidarity, responsibility and for caring for water
        •	Call to action to promote  interfaith dialogue and engagement on water, sanitation and hygiene 


        Expected Results

        •	Demonstrate the role of religions in support of:
        o	 individual/collective practices to ensure equitable access and preserve, use water resources;
        o	social cohesion and peace around water resources;
        o	good governance, equity and service provision for vulnerable populations.


        •	Obtain commitments to address risks of exclusions in policies and practices that promote water and sanitation services, also considering privatization of services
        •	Share good practices in translating religious values into practice to support water and sanitation
        •	Showcase that some religious and faith-based organizations can be valuable partners for administrations, implementing agencies and the broader civil society
        •	Organize an Interfaith action in Dakar (to symbolize dialogue and collaboration), as a follow up to the session or in parallel to engage local populations, not present at the forum, on the session themes
