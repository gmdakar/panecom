      value: 'Access to basic WASH services and facilities in public institutional settings such as healthcare facilities (HCFs) and schools are critical to ensuring people’s health and well-being. Despite the global efforts by a multitude of actors to meet this need, the lack of access to WASH in schools and healthcare facilities remains widespread. Large-scale implementation of WASH in institutions is often under-funded and disconnected from other key national programmes. It is with the goal of fostering a collective vision for scale that we have chosen to focus our action on identifying and amplifying the knowledge on upscaling pathways for WASH in institutions. '
