      value: |-
        Improving the collection, management and processing of data into actionable knowledge that can inform decisions related to adaptation to climate change. For example:
        1. Encourage an overall survey and investigation of natural, social and economic conditions of the areas prone to water risks 
        2. Encourage that vulnerable areas can be equipped with necessary early warning facilities and establish community-based defense system 
        3. Promote the application of data and knowledge in the establishment of a disaster monitoring and forecasting system 
        4. Establish systems of non-structural measures (e.g. water disaster monitoring and early-warning system, improving management, making policies, laws and regulations, improving disaster rescue and insurance) to mitigate risk of water-related disasters 
        5. Improved international exchanges on best practices, advanced technologies and visionary strategies in building resilience to water-related disasters 
        6. Development of citizen sciences which has double benefit of data gathering and awareness raising on water and climate related issues 
        7. Knowledge development to improve water resources management from source to sea, especially to anticipate potential risks such as droughts, flooding, sea level rise.
