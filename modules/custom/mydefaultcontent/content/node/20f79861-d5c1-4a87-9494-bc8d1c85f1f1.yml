        •	The need for solutions in managing water resources is obvious and strong from local to global context, which is vital to tackle emerging water security challenges caused by population growth and climate change. 

        •	Nature-based solutions can play an important role in improving the supply and quality of water and reducing the impact of natural disasters. ‘Green’ infrastructure, as opposed to traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure, focuses on preserving the functions of ecosystems, both natural and built, and environmental engineering rather than civil engineering to improve the quality of water. 

        •	The projects gathered under action 3 will concentrate on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure: how they can improve the quality of water and resources. Action 3 will show in many ways how impactful those solutions can be in project management, both in wastewater treatment and for ecosystems.

        -	Projects gathered under this session will concentrate on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure: how they can improve the quality of water and resources. 
        -	Thus, it will show in many ways how impactful those solutions can be in project management, both in wastewater treatment or for ecosystems with evidence and interaction opportunities

        -	To reflect on the experiences, learnings, achievements and for possible new initiatives, Report (including video format if possible) and Policy Brief will feed in and provide the foundation.
        -	Then, possibilities will be enhanced for project partnerships between Organizations/Stakeholders from planning to implementation in real ground 

        -	The outcomes of session will contribute to SDG6, particularly achieving Target 6.2, 6.3, and 6.b, including the connection to SDG13.
