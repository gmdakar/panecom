        Climate change primarily affects water with unpredictable rainfall patterns, aquatic ecosystems degradation, altered river flows, sea level rise-induced salinization of coastal groundwater, more frequent and intense floods and droughts. Water-related disasters represent about 90% of all natural disasters.

        To address these challenges, our societies need to make the most of existing solutions, including by combining classic concrete infrastructures and nature-based solutions.

        In order to avoid maladaptation, there is a need to seek, in a taylor-made fashion for  each hydrographic basin and in each city, the right balance between green and grey infrastructures!
