        Access to sanitation remains a key issue for millions of people. 2.4 billion still lack access to basic sanitation, and 1.2 billion of these live in fragile or extremely fragile contexts. The COVID-pandemic only disclosed the fragility of the achievements by various stakeholders so far and highlights the importance of collaboration among WASH, health, and environment sectors for sustainable results.
        Addressing these issues, the session focuses on successfully completed or ongoing programmes and projects showcasing the integrated policy and management efforts among WASH, Health and Environment sectors and advocates for their scaling up to raise the profile and strengthen the sustainable collaboration of WASH and broader health and environment sectors to address the needs of their common target groups, incl. vulnerable population, women, and youth, etc.
