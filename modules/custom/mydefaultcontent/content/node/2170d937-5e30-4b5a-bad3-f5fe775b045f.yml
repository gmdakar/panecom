      value: 'Addressing the policy, institutional and regulatory aspects of water and sanitation service delivery is more crucial than ever before. The reason? PIR is a key enabler of other levers – such as financing, infrastructure, and technical solutions - for meeting SDG6. By focusing on an integrated approach, PIR can help address systemic challenges to sustainability – such as climate change and short-term crises and shocks.   This session will zoom in on how PIR can be an enabler of financial and technical solutions and enhance their impact for better services.'

        1.	(10 mins.) Welcome by hosts  
        Hosts welcome organizers, participants and guests, outlining the session for the audience and introducing some of the key lessons and messages emerging from their work.
        •	Dambudzo Muzenda, Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist, Water Global Practice, The World Bank.
        •	Dr. Franz Rojas-Ortuste, Coordinator of the Water Agenda at CAF (Development bank of Latin America).

        2.	(75 mins.) Panel: Zoom-in PIR as enabler
        Hosts join high level guests to zoom-in how PIR can be an enabler of financial and technical solutions and enhance their impact for WSS. Discussions are structured around 3 main questions:

        (25 mins) Q 1 – Policies: While many countries have developed WSS policies, plans and legislation, implementation remains a key challenge. What are the greatest obstacles to implementing sound policies and regulations?

        (25 mins) Q 2 – Institutions: The capacity constraints facing water institutions – particularly local authorities and utilities - are well documented. What kind of incentives, models or practices are needed to finally crack this long-standing challenge?

        (25 mins) Q 3 – Regulation: Regulation can be very effective in incentivizing improvements in sector outcomes. But regulation has arguably been under-valued or under-utilized. Do you agree? How can regulation work better to advance the WSS agenda?

        Panelists
        •	Kelvin Chitumbo, Director of the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO), Zambia.
        •	Amadou Diallo PIU Coordinator for the Senegal Rural Water Supply Project and senior civil servant within the government of Senegal.
        •	Malena Galmarini, President of Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos (AySA), Argentina, and of the Asociación Latinoamericana de Operadores de Agua y Sanemiento (ALOAS).
        •	Dr. Teodoro Estrela Monreal, director general of Water, Secretaría de Estado de Medio Ambiente, Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, Spain. 
        •	Dr Oriana Romano, Head of Unit, Water Governance and Circular Economy in Cities in the OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Cities and Regions.

        3.	(5 mins.) Closing remarks to synthesize key messages and implications for the future of PIR
