      value: 'The High-Level Panel (HLP) is intended to be a follow up event after the plenary session of the celebration of the UN-World Water Day 2022 organized by UNESCO and UN-WATER about the topic of the UNWWDay  Groundwater: Making the invisible visible. The HLP panel will allow to organize a larger and in-depth debate about the UN Development Report 2022 that is presented the 21st of March at the opening with the participation of high-level countries representatives and high-level experts.  The HLP is meant to discuss how groundwater can be a response to water security challenges. Special attention will be paid to the implementation of SDG6 Global Acceleration Framework. The main findings of the HLP will be considered at the UN-Water Groundwater Summit to be organized 7-8 December 2022 at UNESCO HQs and a mean to support a focus on groundwater during the 2023 UN Water conference. The HLP will give special focus on investments in Groundwater in Africa and SIDS and examine how groundwater offers a potential pathway to sustain human activities and ecosystems health, with a particular focus on Africa and SIDS.  Africa, the youngest continent, needs more than other special attention to groundwater, to ensure water security for future generations.  There are 72 transboundary aquifers in Africa, that represent a potential for socio-economic development of the region.'
