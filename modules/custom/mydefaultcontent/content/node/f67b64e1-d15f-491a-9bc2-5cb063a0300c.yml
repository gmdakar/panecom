        Ecosystem-based approaches to land, water coastal and marine resources management require information from many disciplines and actors, beyond conventional measures that address specific segments of the source-to-sea system and neglect linkages. Collecting (or modeling), analyzing, and communicating this information is vital for both monitoring (e.g., SDGs) and decision making, but the resources for data acquisition and knowledge management are insufficient, and data providers and decision makers are not working closely as they could. 
        This session focuses on bridging these “gaps” by promoting: 1) modern methods and tools that provide or synthesize relevant data for ecosystem-based management and 2) networks to share experience and skill transfer to build capacity in decision-support. It will feature innovative approaches, such as using remote sensing as a complement to in-situ monitoring, and will also highlight examples from around the world where data is being transformed into knowledge and to help decision/policy makers better incorporate ecosystem protection into water resource management
