        Adaptation to climate change requires a strong knowledge of its impacts, especially on water resources and related ecosystems: we cannot manage what we do not know. 
        The current Sentinel / Copernicus constellation, the upcoming SWOT and TRISHNA mission can be combined to build knowledge regarding rainfall, discharge and evaporation. More generally, “multi-sensor” satellite data can be mobilized, since these data are essential for water resource management and climate change adaptation. 
        Hydro-meteorological Information systems can integrate both data from classical in situ monitoring networks and satellite altimetry data.

        - Strengthening of the hydrological information systems of the different institutions, Basin Organizations and their Member States, including data from both virtual and in situ monitoring stations. 
        - Development of applications that enhance water information systems for biodiversity preservation and water uses, climate change monitoring and adaptation. This component will develops downstream services: forecasting models, dynamics of flooded areas and wetlands, allocation models for strategic planning, water quality, etc. Specific applications will beare dedicated to the monitoring of large dams (hydropower / irrigation) and water surfaces using satellite data.
        - Strengthening of national and regional capacities, capitalization of long-term information systems for decision-makers and users. Capacity building will beis organized to meet one main objective: ownership by the countries and basin organizations of the technical innovation brought by the project, together with research / science community.
