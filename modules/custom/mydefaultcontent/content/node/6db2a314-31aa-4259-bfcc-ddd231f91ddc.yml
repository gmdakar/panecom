        On 12 August 2021, AMCOW, in collaboration with the UNDP, UNICEF, AUDA-NEPAD, AfDB, GCA, and GWP launched a partnership to convene an International High-Level Panel on Water Investment for Africa. 

        On 8 September 2021, the Executive Committee of AMCOW commended the effort of the convenors and formally adopted a Decision for the inauguration of the Panel.  

        The objective of the Panel is to develop a high-level action-forcing report and investment plan for the 2023 UN Conference and African Union Heads of States with a clear pathway recommendation for African countries on how to mobilize US$30 billion/year towards the water investment gap in Africa, which is estimated at US$45-US$54 billion/year. 

        The HLP event will communicate how the panel can accelerate the transformation required to scale up finance for water security in Africa and showcase ambitious initiatives to accelerate climate-resilient water investments in Africa – such as the?Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) whose goal is to leverage US$ 30 billion in climate-resilient water investments?by 2030; as well as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) that aims to mobilise $25 billion by 2025 and galvanise climate resilient actions through a triple win approach to address the impacts of Covid-19, climate change and the economy. 

        Event objectives:

        1.	Introduce the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa and explore perspectives for  accelerating scaled-up finance for water investments
        2.	Introduce the convenors for the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments and showcase new and ongoing climate resilient water related initiatives to mobilise investments and finance
