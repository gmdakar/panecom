        What are the new perspectives on drought in a time of climate change? Drought is often compared with other natural hazards such as floods, storms, and wildfires. However, unlike these hazards, drought is often a so-called hidden risk, meaning that its onset is not perceived until drought conditions are already having an impact. 

        In many countries worldwide and as a result of climate change, droughts are becoming more severe with higher negative and large-scale impacts. Also, incidences of severe heat waves and short-term dryness (flash droughts) seem to increase. The session objective is to look at the developments in droughts in a time of climate change and how that may change our perspectives on dealing with the increasing issue. 

        The keynote speech will introduce the different types of drought events, and how the frequency, magnitude and severity are changing due to changing climate (evolution of droughts, its definition and identification). Representatives of different international organizations will be invited to present and discuss management principles formulated to guide and support decision-makers in dealing with droughts. Specific attention will be paid to the intrinsic nature of drought as cross-border (with specific attention to the role of groundwater in dealing with droughts), cross-sectoral and cross-institutional. The HELP Flagship report on drought will also be launched during the event. It suggests ten guiding principles for effective drought management. Finally, those principles will guide the discussion with panel members. Regional and national representatives will look back at those principles and reflect on what these principles concretely mean for their own country and what steps are needed to address the full range of risks and impacts associated with shifting and dynamic hydrologic cycles. By linking principles collected from experiences worldwide to local experiences, an interaction is started that leads to mutual influence to cater for the developments that climate change brings. This will lead to conclusions and take-home messages on how climate change influences droughts, what mechanisms are in place to mitigate the impacts of droughts on livelihoods and what steps might be needed to facilitate their implementation.

        The session targets influential leaders and decision-makers from government, business, and civil society who are dealing with droughts.
