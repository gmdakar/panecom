      value: 'The Human Right to Water is a critical component of the international rights framework, and is a necessary component of the advancement of human society and development. Coming on the heels of the 10th anniversary of the UN General Assembly''s adoption of Resolution 64/292''s explicit right to water and with the 20th anniversary of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights'' General Comment 15 recognizing the human right to water coming later this year, this panel asks: where are we now and where are we going? This wide-reaching panel will bring together voices from the forefront of these efforts, showing how the law, education, journalism, technology, and development can help drive the next two decades of action.'

        We believe that the session can be a springboard for fundamental changes in governance for the sector, and can provide a roadmap for organizations, governments, citizens and journalists to better harmonize and protect water and water access in their countries.  Building off of the past and creating a vision for the future will also demand a great deal of education, advocacy, technology, law, journalism and other efforts before and after the Forum, and we will be developing follow-on partnerships to deliver this during the period. 

        The Forum is a chance to harness great hope, a reemerging world looking to solve problems, and a population who knows—now more than ever—how important water is. By staking a clear claim and setting a clear path for water, we believe that we can set the course for water for the next two decades.
