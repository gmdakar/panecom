        As the syntheses of various measures and recommendations, it is necessary to strengthen the following four pillars: 
        ?	Science and technology: to accelerate policy implementation and monitoring processes;
        ?	Governance: to enhance governance, institutional and legal frameworks and enforcement at regional, national, sub-national levels. This includes the improvement of sectoral awareness about inter-linkage between water and economic development to accelerate water sectors reform by encouraging the consultation and meaningful participation of various stakeholders for the co-design and co-implementation of fair legislation, regulation, and institutional arrangements through community empowerment; 
        ?	Financial and economic instruments: to ensure the diversification of economic revenue for investing in water security and creating job opportunities;
        ?	Capacity building and gender: to build capacity and integrate gender in a cross-cutting manner across sectors and regions.

        Political leadership should be strengthened through rigorous research and analysis on ongoing regional initiatives that measure and track the progress of water security indices in all the region's countries.

        The importance of developing a water-sensitive culture through education at all levels – formal and informal – requires recognition and investment in policy development and financial resources, including the measures to enhance the participation of women in leadership positions in the water sector.
