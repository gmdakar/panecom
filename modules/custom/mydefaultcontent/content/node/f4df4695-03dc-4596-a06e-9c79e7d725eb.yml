        The Special session on the Global Observatory for Water and Peace will facilitate dialogue between politicians, diplomats, actors from the water as well as from the peace and security sector, and will present the Pole Eau Dakar- the West-African regional partner to the Global Observatory for Water and Peace. 

        Guiding questions:
         - How the development of a network of like-minded actors that put the emphasis on neutrality, multilateralism and science-policy interface like the GOWP can contribute to the Water and Peace agenda?
         - What are the developments to date globally, regionally and nationally in terms of endorsing and using the potential of water for better cooperation ?
        - How can the safe space assist in bridging different perspectives of a water related tension and in the use of water for peacebuilding? 
        - How can bottom-up approaches be better integrated into the water and peace dialogue and how can the GOWP contribute to strengthen this approach?
        - How the PED will assure the follow-up – in particular in Africa-  of the major initiatives in Dakar22 , and  report these developments to the 2023 UN water conference.
