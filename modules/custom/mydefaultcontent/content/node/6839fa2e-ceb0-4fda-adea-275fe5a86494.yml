      value: 'Maintaining water quality is crucial for efficient water resources management. Improving water quality can be achieved by more balanced and multidisciplinary approach to the research, policy-making, and practices. Sound governance, using an inclusive multi-stakeholder approach and knowledge-based policymaking, is a key to improve water security. The Session will provide elements for a better understanding of how governance, partnerships, inclusiveness and strong policies can make a significant change in water quality.'
