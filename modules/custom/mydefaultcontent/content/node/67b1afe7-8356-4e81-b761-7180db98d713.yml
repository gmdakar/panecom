      value: 'Investing in nature-based solutions, such as preserving or restoring wetlands and natural flood management measures, is essential to enhance water security. These solutions can complement or substitute for grey infrastructure, such as built reservoirs and water treatment plants. Mobilising funding for those solutions raises specific challenges, as they generate multiple benefits for a diverse range of beneficiaries - and only some of these benefits can be monetised. Yet,  nature is often one of today''s greatest investments, particularly to address the twin crisis of climate change and biodiversity loss. The session will provide practical guidance for practitioners and investors on how funding for nature-based solutions for water security can be arranged and financing mobilised. '
