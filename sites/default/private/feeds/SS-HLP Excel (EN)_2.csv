At the 9th session (2021) of the Meeting of the Parties to the 1992 Water Convention, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched the publication on Funding and Financing transboundary water cooperation and basin development, also presenting innovative Financing Initiatives, including the Blue Peace Financing Initiative.  Co-created by Basin Organisations, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) as the main implementing agency and other stakeholders, the Blue Peace Financing Initiative combines public and private finance to develop and implement transboundary master- and joint investment plans. It will promote access to public and private capital for Transboundary Organizations (e.g. River Basin Organizations (RBOs)). The main objective of this High-Level Panel (HLP) will be to launch the Blue Peace Financing Initiative, showing how innovative financing mechanisms can transform water into an instrument for transboundary, multi-sectoral and inter-generational cooperation frameworks, leading to peaceful societies and circular economies. 
Outcomes: It will provide a new financial incentive for countries and sectors to cooperate and establish political agreements on the sustainable management of shared resources, reducing social, political, economic and environmental risks and conflicts. Meanwhile, it will change the financial sector’s perception of water, not as a distinct sector, but as an entry-point for multi-sectoral and regional impact investment opportunities.";"Opening Session:

With the support of the Swiss Confederation, the Geneva Water Hub invites you to contribute to the discussion on the occasion of the 9th World Water Forum in Dakar.
About two billion people live in areas affected by armed conflicts, where destruction of water infrastructure is increasingly common. As detailed in the ICRC’s Urban Services and UNICEF’s Water Under Fire reports, the consequence on the most vulnerable communities is severe. When water and sanitation services are disrupted water-borne diseases and epidemics proliferate. To advance the protection of these communities, the Geneva Water Hub has developed the Geneva List of Principles on the Protection of Water Infrastructure. While the main focus of this document is the clarification of norms of international humanitarian law applicable to water infrastructure,   the Geneva Principles also aim at enhancing cooperation on installations located on transboundary water resources in peace time and the protection of the human rights to water and sanitation at all times. This High-Level Panel will provide a unique opportunity to explore cross-sectoral linkages between the SDG 6 on water and sanitation and SDG 16 on peace.

It will highlight key guiding questions that can contribute to advancing the global discussion on water economics and financing that will be explored in a major forthcoming review to be prepared for the UN 2023 Water Conference.

The session will engage leading economic thinkers, government ministers, and leaders of financial and intergovernmental institutions. The panel will draw on a broad foundation of experience with the Roundtable on Financing Water as well as recent analytical work on financing water from the OECD, the World Bank and the World Water Council. This work includes the forthcoming OECD synthesis report Financing a water secure future, analysis of the role of intermediaries to mobilise finance, blended finance for water in specific country contexts, investors’ guidelines for nature-based solutions, and the implications of the pandemic on financing water.   

Key questions to be explored include:
•	Going beyond traditional economic approaches, what insights and perspectives can inspire new policy orientations, financing and citizen engagement?
•	What key levers are required to drive transformational action on the ground? 

An expected outcome of the session is to recast the orientation of global discussions on the financing and economics of water security and give impetus to meaningful financing approaches that can be implemented on the ground to contribute to the achievement of SDG 6.

The initiative relies on the ""Water & Nature Declaration"" to be endorsed by public and private organisations, supported by a call to action enjoining each signatory of the declaration to submit at least one project, either to be implemented in the future or already in progress, either political/institutional or technical, in line with the definition of Nature Based Solutions.
The expected actions address key societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of natural and modified ecosystems for the benefit of both biodiversity and human well-being. The initiative also welcomes projects from companies that have carried out actions to restore natural resources and ecosystems, contributing to sustainable development, in line with the SDGs, adopting a pro-nature attitude.
The session will demonstrate the need and relevance of water and nature policies, based on innovative initiatives from multiple locations in the world, with a strong focus on NbS as strategic measures for this matter.

This project aims to unite the Sahelian States around the issues of combating desertification and adapting to climate change in a logic of sustainable economic development.
 The project aims by 2030 to :
- Restore 100 million hectares of degraded land
- Create 10 million green jobs
- Sequester 250 million tons of carbon 
Since its official launch in 2007, it has been noted that the project is struggling to achieve its objectives, leading to the establishment in January 2021 of the Great Green Wall Accelerator supported by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) with an announced funding of 14 billion euros between 2021-2025. This new impetus in the implementation of the GGW proposes to academic actors of excellence in West Africa and their partners to propose and test agro-ecological and nature-based solutions, innovative and adapted to local contexts. 
The objective of this roundtable will be to draw up the issues, methodologies, innovations and perspectives to propose viable solutions based on innovation, nature and the structuring of economic and social sectors for a better management of water resources in the context of accelerating GGW in West Africa.

The resilience of water supply systems play a fundamental role in the strategic planning of those responsible for the sanitation sector to permanently serve the various water users, especially the supply for inhabitants of urban and rural areas where the resources are no longer available in abundance
The water and sanitation sector plays an important role in reducing the impact of human activity on the environment, a characteristic that should be better exploited to enable the sector's development, for example, transforming the generation of waste and the sewage into new resources, and enabling cleaner rivers and water bodies. In adition, how to serve thousands of people who live in irregular settlements and end up polluting rivers and water supply sources? Many water and sewage operating companies have been implementing unconventional measures to help adresss the problem.
Therefore, Adaptation, Risk mitigation, Redundance, Reuse and Safe Environment are topics approached by major water and sewage operators worldwide nowadays and this panel will allow, theexchange of experiences, the opportunity to share strategies, methods, and practices by several sanitation companies.
Thus, the aim is, in a global way, to reflect on changes in the way in which governments and providers of basic sanitation services act and mainly help decision makers and public authorities to implement public policies concerning the approached topics.";"15 minutes each speaker, and 15 for questions and answers.

High-Level Panel;HLP14;Outcomes of the Global Water Policy Report 2021: Listening to National Water Leaders  ;Wednesday 23rd of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Wednesday 23rd of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Room 11;"A panel of Ministers will discuss the outcomes of the Global Water Policy Report 2021 and its relevance to their work, topics for the 2023 report (to be announced at this event) and how to maximise participation and value in the next Water Leaders Survey.  The session will also include a brief overview of the report findings and a presentation by a senior United Nations official on how the report will support implementation of the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework.

The Global Water Policy Report 2021 is a world-first comprehensive survey revealing the water management challenges of Ministers, top officials and other national water leaders in 88 countries, representing a combined population of over 6 billion people.
Among their many messages, national water leaders are saying:
•	The highest water-related risks their countries face are from climate change and associated pressures on water supplies and worsening floods and droughts.
•	The greatest challenges many face are with integration and prioritisation of water issues within governments. Administrative problems of fragmented water institutions are of as much, if not greater, concern than factors such as public resistance to reforms.
•	COVID-19 has not much affected the priority of water and sanitation services.
•	Sustainable Development Goals on water are ‘challenging’ or ‘impossible’ for many, with governance problems and lack of financing the main reasons for this.
•	While groundwater is considered by many national water leaders to be essential to their country’s future water supply, far fewer consider their groundwater is being used sustainably.

High-Level Panel;HLP17;Policy Dialogues in Water-Scarce Countries for Achieving SDGs: Towards the UN Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Water Action Decade;Tuesday 22nd of March from 9.00 to 10.30;Tuesday 22nd of March from 9.00 to 10.30;Room 205;"The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) organized the second H.L. Segment in a series of international meetings to develop water scare countries' messages to be submitted to the U.N. Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Water Action Decade, March 2023. Regional and International partners support the roadmap for the Policy dialogues in water-scarce countries to achieve SDGs. The issues raised during the high-level segment of Cairo Water Week 2021 (CWW2021) will be discussed in a series of regional events starting from the 9th WWF Dakar 2022, in cooperation with relevant organizations and partners. The Main Conclusions of the CWW2021 high-level segment comprised focused five main items including (1) Water Scarcity and Accessibility; (2) Water & Climate Cooperation; (3) Finance: Challenges vs. Opportunities; (4) Innovation tools for sustainable water management and (5) Transboundary Cooperation: Opportunities and Challenges. These discussions seek to turn the tide on cross-sectoral implementation of the water-related goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

The purpose of the session is to collect the messages of water-scarce countries to cope with the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, proclaiming the period 2018 to 2028. The International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development UNGA Resolution 73/226 Decides to convene, in New York, from 22 to 24 March 2023, the United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of “Water for Sustainable Development.” Furthermore, UNGA resolution 75/212 indicates that the Midterm Review Conference shall be preceded by regional and global preparatory meetings and informed by existing water-related discussions at the regional and international levels.
Integrated Water Resources Management acknowledges that water needs to be managed as a system – where water system boundaries often do not correlate with political or administrative boundaries. Therefore, integrated solutions are required to achieve good governance and increase water use efficiency and sustainability, followed by practical and coordinated cross-sectoral implementation. Such actions would enhance achieving the zero-hunger goal and significantly contribute to other goals.

Egypt attaches great importance to the UN Decade for Action on Water and Sustainable Development (2018-2028) and the UN Mid-term Review conference in 2023, the first UN Conference on Water since 1977. This importance emanates from the indispensability of water to human life, as human beings have no source but water for life, food, and agriculture. In addition, water plays a significant role in sustainable development and regional integration, among other things. Therefore, the lead-up to the 2023 Conference, the Conference itself, and its follow-up is crucial in building political momentum towards achieving SDG 6 and other water-related goals and targets. In this context, the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt included Cairo Water Week’s two sessions of October 2021 and November 2022 and other relevant international events, including the 9th WWF, within the framework of the preparatory meetings towards the 2023 Mid-term Review Conference, to contribute to building consensus ahead of the Conference and providing substantive inputs.

Droughts are evolving. The word “drought” itself presents a challenge, as drought is understood and experienced differently depending on a range of socio-economic, geographic and cultural factors, and drought definitions are evolving. What are the new perspectives on drought, in a time of climate change ? 

The speech will also highlight the need for collaboration and knowledge sharing to tackle the drought challenges, due to the intrinsic cross-borders and cross-sectoral nature of droughts.

20min – Effective drought management for present and future challenges
In the last years, several international organisations have been looking at guiding principles and best practices for drought management. What are the impacts of drought and how are they impacted as climate change effects unfold? And how can we ensure effective drought management in the long-term, aligning with the Global Agenda’s (e.g. SDG’s or the Sendai Framework) ? 
Three pitches will look at different aspects for effective drought management, namely: 
cross-borders, highlighted through the impact on groundwater, by UNESCO (TBC) 
cross-sectoral, looking at the nexus between drought and the impact on biodiversity and land-use, by UNCCD (TBC)
cross-institutional, looking on effective governance, by World Bank (TBC)

10min – Releasing the HELP Flagship report on drought 
Video and short presentation highlighting 10 Guiding Principles developed in the report as an efficient way to tackle those new perspectives on drought. 

30min – Dealing with drought: how to act at the local level ?
Those principles and best practices are formulated to support management at the local level. How are they implemented and what is needed to bring it one step further? And do they suffice given the climate change developments? Interventions from decision-makers at the local (or regional) level, with cases from the Sahel region, Middle-East, North America and Europe.

Special Session;SS01;The Nature for Water Facility launch event: enabling local champions to deliver watershed NbS investments ;Monday 21st of March from 14.00 to 15.30;Monday 21st of March from 14.00 to 15.30;Room 11;"Objective:
This is the public launch session for the Nature for Water Facility, a technical assistance facility designed to provide a suite of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) consultancy services for water security.  The session will highlight why NbS matter, provide case studies of their successful impact, describe the value proposition of this new program, and showcase how members of the global water sector community can partner and deliver on-the-ground watershed results. 

Session Description:
Nature-based Solutions – such as reforestation, landscape restoration, and agricultural best management practices – offer promising avenues for driving catchment health and water security outcomes. They also help deliver meaningful co-benefits such as sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity protection, and carbon sequestration.

However, despite growing interest in mainstreaming NbS into the water sector, they remain <0.1% of annual global investment spend. This is partially driven by a market failure in the availability of technical assistance to equip local champions with the necessary expertise to originate, design, and execute watershed investment programs.

The Nature Conservancy (a global environmental non-profit) and Pegasys (an Africa-based sustainable infrastructure consultancy) are pleased to use this Special Session as the official launch the Nature for Water Facility. This four-year program is designed to bridge the 'nature gap' by providing a suite of NbS consultancy services to local clients seeking to build out watershed investment programs'.

The 2020-2030 decade will be decisive (MDGs, climate action...). We need to change our way of thinking, we need to build differently.
Building differently means moving from not doing (neglecting the rural world) or ""doing"" (top-down, silo-based, technocratic actions and policies) to ""doing with"": with people, with nature and with territories. 
Providing answers that meet the challenges requires more living soil, more agronomy, more water and more mobilization and investment. These are central issues, political in the noble sense of the term, which require new long-term visions, systemic analyses and territorialized approaches. 
The special session follows two international meetings ""on the road to Dakar"", organized in October 2021 (7th edition of the seminar on water and food security in West Africa and the Mediterranean -SESAME- and the Parmenides Conference of Bari on the management of watersheds in the Mediterranean). Based on their conclusions, it aims to :
- to highlight the elements of long-term vision and, through concrete examples, the possible contents and scope of ""building differently
- to propose the elements of policies implementing the levers of a transition at different territorial scales,
- to bring out political messages that will contribute to the success of the Forum and its high-level panels.";"9:00-9:15: Introduction.

Special Session;SS04;Making invisible visible: Groundwater Catalogue for informed policy development and management interventions - UPDATE;Tuesday 22nd of March from 10.45 to 12.15;Tuesday 22nd of March from 10.45 to 12.15;Room 13;"The groundwater governance and management process involve identifying the required legal, regulatory, and institutional arrangements to establish public guardianship and collective responsibility for groundwater resources, and to introduce technical management measures with stakeholder integration and cross-sector coordination. Due to the diversity and complexity of water problems, it is often challenging to identify the role of groundwater and adequately incorporate it in the decision-making process. Moreover, policy makers and managers do not always have a sufficient overview of tools, measures and instruments that could be applied in specific and complex issues. 
This special session will be about strengthening interface science-policy-practice interface using newly developed Catalogue to facilitate this process.
The Catalogue on Groundwater Management is meant for a  better provision of information on groundwater management tools,  measures and instruments, encompassing a supply and demand, groundwater protection and  stakeholder participation. The catalogue will enable policy- and decisionmakers to better explore suitable solutions for complex groundwater issues, based on factsheets, case studies and references. 
Objective of the session is to actively involve groundwater policy- and decision makers in development and verification of the Catalogue.  This on-site, interactive session is necessary to attract future co-developers and users of the Catalogue. The outcome of the session will provide content necessary for the continuity  of the process. Eventually, the end-users will take ownership of the Catalogue and care for further improvements (similarly to Wikipedia).   ";"Opening remarks (A. Aureli – science; EPA Repr. ) - 10min

Measuring the effectiveness of finance delivery for drought management at community level;Wednesday 23rd of March from 9.00 to 10.30;Wednesday 23rd of March from 9.00 to 10.30;Room 201;"With a steady increase in climate finance flow from developed to developing countries, there is a growing need to rigorously measure the real-term additionality, the consistency and ultimately the impacts on final beneficiaries in real terms. Increasing the effectiveness of drought finance is of vital interest for both financing partners and communities, whose inherent heterogeneity and diverse needs put a constraint on harmonizing the financing mechanisms and call for more flexible and innovative approaches. Many climate financing mechanisms have already introduced methods to assess their impacts. The approaches, records and retrieved data on the results, however, are often unfitting and insufficient, and a better understanding of the current situation is highly desirable, to share lessons on measuring the effectiveness.
The side event contributes to the global debate on measuring effectiveness of drought financing from the perspective of end-users and it involves a coherent set of sessions, as follows:
•	Stocktaking of existing financing actors and public climate financing operations to line up the disaggregated trends and status of drought mitigation and adaptation in climate financing;
•	Analysing approaches of targeting investments towards the most vulnerable to achieve impact-at-scale, and methods for measuring and monitoring the impacts of the investment;
•	Providing showcases on community-based investment designs in support of assessing the effectiveness;
•	Discussing the potential of innovative financing mechanisms in support of the transition from a reactive and emergency assistance to a proactive and preparedness finance (e. g. forecast-based financing, risk financing, etc.)";"Opening remarks: HL Official (AU?) - 5 mins

The artisanal and semi-industrial sectors involve more than 6 million people. This number is steadily increasing. Significant revenues are received. However, social tensions and considerable environmental impacts are generated, at different spatial and temporal scales, which need to be better understood in order to provide sustainable control solutions built and accepted by all stakeholders. 
The integrated management of water resources in mining areas, as well as the quality of water, effluents from ore processing or the exposure of waste from active or past mining activities, is a major issue for life and public health. Private and public operators, communities and populations are strongly concerned on a territorial scale beyond the strict perimeter of the exploited areas. The construction of viable solutions to address the complex issues raised requires the implementation of new scientific paradigms, based on a multi-stakeholder, multi- and interdisciplinary dialogue, on participatory research and on open and shared science.
Conducted in English and French, the objective of this roundtable will be to address the issues, methodologies, innovations and perspectives to propose viable solutions, including those inspired by nature, to better understand, preserve or restore hydro-ecosystems, to ensure better quantitative and qualitative management of the resource ""water"" of mining basins in West Africa and in the global context of emergencies and transitions.";"A 90-minute session is proposed. It will be sequenced as follows: 

Session 1: Major regional scientific issues for IWRM in mining areas in West Africa. 20 minutes of exchanges between 4 speakers and 10 minutes of questions and answers. 

This first session will aim to map the main mining sites by type of exploitation in West Africa and the impacts on water resources. It will present the main economic and human development issues associated. The panel will consist of two representatives of academic actors (Harouna Karambiri - 2iE, Alphonse Yao - INPHB), a representative of public actors (Dr. DIENE SAMBA ROKHAYA, Director of Geology of Senegal, a representative of a private actor BAMBA ZAKARI, ¨President of the Union of Mining Producers and Purchasers of WAEMU and a representative of the civil society (to be identified) 
Session 2: Towards a multi-stakeholder, multi-disciplinary dialogue. 20 minutes of exchanges between 4 speakers and 10 minutes of questions and answers. 
A second session will address the issue of the lack of dialogue between actors involved in the issue and how to move from a silo organization to a multi-stakeholder dialogue allowing the co-construction of practices and regulations adapted to the contexts. The panel will include Mr. Emile Kaboré (Head of the Mining and Hydrocarbons Division of WAEMU), Mr. Lamine Seydou Traoré, Minister of Mines, Water and Energy of Mali (to be confirmed), Mr. Felix Abagale (Director of the WACWISA UDS Center of Excellence, Ghana), Mr. Daouda Mama (Director of the C2EA, Benin) and a representative of a mining company (to be identified).  
Session 3: Presentation of innovative solutions for better IWRM in mining territories. 20 minutes of exchanges between 4 speakers and 10 minutes of questions and answers. 
 This last session will close our session with a concrete presentation of existing solutions for a better management of water resources in mining territories. These solutions, based on science, must be shared, tested and scaled up to reach our sustainable development goals.

Women remain underrepresented with respect to employment and participation to decision-making at all levels in the water domain. Eight years to the end-date of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, bold and ambitious concrete action is urgently needed.

Unlocking progress towards gender equality in water needs solid knowledge, practical solutions, and collaborative action. UNESCO WWAP together with a Multi-stakeholder Coalition, which includes Member States’ institutions, international and regional organizations, academia and NGOs, is leading a global Call for Action for accelerating progress towards gender equality in the water domain and building just and resilient societies. 

This special session presents the efforts on the ground to reach the common goal and to close the data gap in the water sector in pursuit of gender equality. Mobilised by the Call for Action Initiative, a number of organizations and experts will discuss strategies and good practices in overcoming persistent gender-related challenges in water. Similarly, the session will explore how decision makers in different global regions are addressing gender inequalities in water governance and in adaptive integrated water management, as well as share knowledge on approaches to increase the resilience and inclusion of community members.";"Welcoming words (5 min)

These mobilizations are developing rapidly in view of demographics and global warming, but at the cost of sharply rising energy consumption that runs counter to climate objectives.
The information on this evolving subject is incomplete, not updated, not validated and not shared despite the inventories of Aquastat, Desaldata or IRENA. International organizations such as AFD, EBRD or IEA commit significant expenses for studies that only provide a partial and punctual picture of the situation.
Thanks to its professional network and partners, the EMI has identified a strong expectation of water and energy stakeholders (planners, designers, builders, operators, researchers, etc.) for an international observatory that would gather and make accessible information on this topic (indicators, maps, installations, projects, experts, regulations, etc.) while allowing dynamic exchanges between countries. The sharing of experiences would thus make available the best practices or innovations in the technical, economic or social field, which are the only ones capable of achieving the SDGs. The launch of this observatory is possible thanks to the project prepared by the EMI and of which a prototype realized by a group of countries will be shown in Dakar.";"

It will highlight concrete water and climate solutions brought by different groups that have proven to be sustainable in the countries and sectors where they were implemented (e.g., in food security, social inclusion, transboundary cooperation, etc.). In an interactive way, it will dissect some of those cases to allow the participants to reach conclusions and recommendations jointly. 

The session will also mark the global launch of the GWP Toolbox: IWRM Action Hub which apart from offering the world’s most comprehensive selection of knowledge resources on IWRM (90 Tools, 250 case studies and 2,500 resources), will also serve as a connecting hub for water professionals who will be able to connect and exchange in the Communities of Practice hosted in the ActionHub. The participants will have the opportunity to enhance their knowledge through practical tips and hands-on activities though our various Communities.  

GWP and WMO will also jointly launch a new challenge/contest for innovative Knowledge to Action (K2A) solutions contributing to climate adaptation and mitigation, which will be directly submitted and featured on the IWRM ActionHub. Rather than focusing on technological and scientific approaches, these solutions should clearly highlight how they are fostering systemic change for becoming more water and climate secure.

The latter are dependent on water resources for their socio-economic activities. 
Moreover, the real needs of the vulnerable rural population are not really taken into account and sufficiently represented in the decision-making process concerning hydro-agricultural investment projects and territorial development. 
Therefore, this special thematic session aims to emphasize the need to ensure rural development that takes into account the real needs of vulnerable populations, often unable to cope with global changes. 
It will also allow :
To present Morocco's programs and sectoral strategies aimed at strengthening the resilience of populations to climate hazards (the Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation Program 2020-2027, the Generation Green Strategy 2020-2030, the National Watershed Management Plan, INDH......)

Special Session;SS17;Egypt National Water Resources Plan as a Tool for Achieving SDGs;Tuesday 22nd of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Tuesday 22nd of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Room 2;"Water challenges in countries that suffer from water scarcity have become more complex than before, especially in light of population increases, rising standards of living, and an increase in demand for water from competing sectors. In addition, the effects of climate change and complex cooperation with riparian countries sharing international rivers add more pressure, especially with unilaterally adopted decisions that would increase challenges and threaten the stability and peace of the region. Integrated Water Resources Management strategies acknowledge that water needs to be managed as a system – where water system boundaries often do not correlate with political or administrative boundaries. For achieving good governance and increasing water use efficiency and sustainability, integrated solutions are needed, followed by effective and coordinated cross-sectoral implementation. Such actions would enhance the process of achieving the SDGs.

Water scarcity in Egypt will increase for several reasons. Climate change may result in less predictable annual inflow into Lake Nasser, reduced rainfall in northern Egypt, and increased crop water requirements. Projected population growth is an even predominant determinant of increased water scarcity. In 2037, the amount of available freshwater per capita of the population; is expected to be less than 35% of 2017 levels. A larger population has greater demands for drinking water, while the sustained economic growth intended by Egypt will increase industrial freshwater demands, and return flows of water from domestic and industrial uses will affect its suitability for further use. The agricultural sector will be strongly affected by the growing scarcity of good quality water and will be hard-pressed to continue to contribute 12% to GDP and to prevent the existing food gap from widening further.
The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) is one of the oldest agencies in the Egyptian government. Its establishment dates back to 1836 as an institution that carries thousands of years of unique experience in irrigation and Nile River control which is the mainstay of life in Egypt. MWRI is concerned with planning and managing water resources through the implementation of the long-term National Water Resources Plan 2037 (NWRP2037), which has been built primarily on experiences gained and lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NWRP2017. In addition, the current plan is firmly aligned to the vision provided by Egypt’s Sustainable Development Strategy 2030, it also enables Egypt’s society, economy, and environment to share effectively the available water for a robust, balanced, diversified, and knowledge-based economy, characterized by justice, social integration, and participation, and by a balanced and diversified ecosystem. Finally, it is worth mentioning that Egypt has made tangible progress in implementing SDGs No. (6.5.1) which is concerned with the degree of integrated water resources management implementation, as the percentage of implementation of the indicator increased from 40% in 2017 to 63% in 2020.

Moreover, maximizing freshwater use efficiently is needed to cope with water scarcity.
This session presents mitigating measures to the increased water stress over the years in the countries suffering arid conditions with limited freshwater resources. Egypt is pursuing to keep the SDGs in its water strategy, hence, the National Water Research Center (NWRC) of Egypt addresses the relevant research topics that are intended to maximize the benefit from each drop of water. 
Several research outcomes are planned to be presented in the session. The research projects that are going to be presented are focused on the UN-SDG targets which address wastewater treatment and safe reuse, and increase water-use efficiency.
The NWRC research facilities, capabilities, and innovation are going to be highlighted. Then in line with the NWRC research for wastewater reuse as a potential water resource, the NWRC’s researchers developed an affordable compact technique for the treatment of wastewater. The outflow from the treatment process shows a very good quality of water that might be reused for broad uses.
The long experience of the NWRC in water quality monitoring networks towards the reuse drainage water along with safe-water reuse is going to be presented. Considering the concept that each water drop is counted, the rainwater harvesting techniques that used in Egypt. Finally, the safety management of hydraulic structures for efficient water management is going to be presented focusing on the Egyptian Experience.

Most exciting, however, will be the presentation of concrete initiatives for innovation in water and sanitation and IWRM financing, including those based on testing and scaling up solutions involving private sector actors and other non-traditional sources of finance. Particularly for low-income countries, the decline in official development assistance volumes in recent years suggests the need for other emerging mechanisms such as blended finance strategies. It is also relevant to recognize that innovation in water financing will be found in the search for productivity niches in operating expenses, in the control of water losses, in the very important potential to be drawn from the circular economy, etc. The World Water Forum in Dakar being an opportunity for an evaluation of the roadmap for the MDG6, this session will highlight very useful levers to revolutionize the development of water financing models in order to put the SDG6 curve back on track in the coming years.;Part 2;Financing | Innovation | Water | Sanitation | IWRM | Private sector | Financing SDGs;Ministère de l'Eau et de l'Assainissement du Sénégal;90'

The region is facing an unprecedented ecological crisis - the drying up of the Aral Sea. For several decades, a significant part of the Aral Sea from a full-flowing ecological system turned into a desert – Aralkum. The region's water resources are predominantly transboundary and form the basis for ensuring food, energy, ecological security, and sustainable socio-economic development of countries.
However, ensuring water security in the region, due to a number of factors, is itself at great risk. The most important challenges in this context are the impact of climate change and population growth.
The Climate Change leads to a more intense melting of glaciers, which are the main sources of the water resources of the region. This problem, combined with population growth, creates a very difficult situation in the region. For example, if in the 1960s the water safety per capita in the region was 8.4 thousand m3 / year, today the indicator has decreased by 4 times - to less than 2.0 thousand m3 / year. Meanwhile, this trend continues and by 2040 the region will become water-deficient, having dropped in terms of water safety to 1.0 thousand m3 per person.
The main objective of the session is to present a united vision and position of the Central Asian region in accordance with the priorities of the 9th WWF and the most important issues for Central Asia, attract the attention of the world community, international development partners, academia, civil society and the private sector to the problems of the Aral Sea basin and their solutions, demonstrate the policy and practice of the region on solving water-ecological, socio-economic issues, the adopted programs and strategies in the region including the Action Program for Assistance to the Countries of the Aral Sea Basin, 2021-2030 (ASBP-4) and the Regional Environmental Program for Sustainable Development in Central Asia (REP4SD-CA) contributing to socio-economic development, achievement of water, energy, ecological and food security in the Central Asian region.

The World Bank, Deltares, and the World Meteorological Organization’s Associated Program for Flood Management (APFM) and Integrated Drought Management Program (IDMP) have teamed up to further explore and operationalize the potential of leveraging synergies in the management of floods and drought. This session will introduce a new perspective for the combined management of floods and drought, will present the application of this new perspective on a case study and will describe the ongoing effort to operationalize this new perspective to help governments tackle flood and drought risks in a combined manner. We hope that this new approach will both inspire and guide governments to reduce the huge toll from floods and drought and provide a key way forward for increased adaptation and resilience. Participants will leave the event with the following take home messages: i) the synergies and opportunities related to flood and drought management; ii) a real life example of the application of this new perspective; iii) clear framework for action; and iv) identification of key actors and possible collaboration in this evolving area.

The first objective is to highlight the benefits of innovative partnerships for protecting, maintaining and/or strengthening water and sanitation services during crises with concrete examples of successful actions. 

The second will be to encourage a dialogue between the public and a representative sample of the diversity of actors present in crises context, in order to collectively identify solutions to foster multi-stakeholder responses for the protection and maintenance of WASH services in crisis contexts. 

Indeed, although examples of unusual alliances of actors have proven their worth, humanitarian interventions are still too often led by traditional humanitarian aid actors with too little involvement of local actors such as civil society, private sector, water utilities, academia or state institutions and municipalities.

This session will also be an opportunity to challenge the audience on the fact that the SDG constitute a valid and relevant framework for humanitarian action. At the beginning of 2022, more than 274 million people are dependent on humanitarian aid, but how could we ensure universal access to water and sanitation services (SDG 6) if this goal does not apply in crisis?

Thus, after a first high-level panel that will introduce the benefits of multi-actor alliances in crises, concrete examples of successful and impactful multi-actor alliances will be presented. This will be followed by an interactive session between the audience and a second panel. The session will conclude with the identification of actions that promote multi-actor approaches and strong partnerships in crisis context.

The impact of the environment on the health of individuals and communities is profound. Nowhere is this reality felt as strongly as on the African continent, where a large proportion of diseases are determined by environmental factors, and where the living conditions of communities (habitat, food, transport) make them extremely vulnerable to changes in the environment and climate.

Through the Libreville Agreements adopted in 2008, 47 African governments pledged to act in an integrated way on the environmental and societal determinants of human health and ecosystem integrity, adopting an environmental policy framework. & Health for Africa under the auspices of WHO and UNEP. Ten years after the signing of these historic agreements, progress has been made, but joint prevention actions remain largely insufficient in view of countries' needs. According to WHO, up to 40% of premature deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are due to environmental pollution (air, water, soil), making it one of the most affected regions in the world.

Beyond the international injunctions, the implementation of these joint programs requires capacities of action (infrastructures, skills) which are today insufficient or absent in most African countries. In this context, the recent publication of the Lancet-WHO Commission urges the governments of these countries to build their capacity for environmental health in planning processes in order to be able to (i) address the associated challenges and strategies, (ii) seek support from development agencies to (iii) design and implement large-scale joint programs and interventions.

Effect-based monitoring (EBM) tools (also known as bioassays) demonstrated in international large scale projects, can now provide a better detection and biosensoring of early toxic mode of action triggered by mixtures of EDCs or DBPs, even at low doses exposures. EBM in water safety planning (WSP) can now be applied to different parts of the water sector: from source to tap, but also for example in wastewater treatment plants, and in water reuse schemes. 

There are strong incentives from governments and institutions such as WHO and the EU to review Water Quality Management Frameworks in various policy areas, and to embed WHO Water Safety Plans

By promoting the interaction of operators and policy-makers from all over the world, the 2018-2022 proof of concept (POC) project aims to increase knowledge and stimulate the exchange and implementation these innovative, more protective, predictive and cost efficient monitoring/diagnosis strategies to better drive water treatment processes and abbatment options to better protect human and ecosystem health regard water chemical mixtures.

In 2020, this sanitation method, often managed informally, represented 72% of the access in rural areas and 78.6% in urban areas. Therefore, formalizing non-sewered sanitation should be considered as a key issue for local authorities, which are usually responsible for this service.

The main objective of this session is to contribute to the achievement of targets 6.2 and 6.3 of SDG 6 on sanitation and wastewater treatment. Specifically, this session aims at presenting on-site sanitation as a sustainable and complementary alternative to the collective centralized system and supporting local governements in its structuring.

This session is based on diferent material :
- case studies realized in Cameroon, Cape Verde and Ghana.
- feedbacks from local elected officials, particularly in the context of decentralized cooperation projects. A project labeled “Initiative Dakar 2022” in Togo will be presented on this occasion.
- a questionnaire developed in coordination with UCLG-Africa, submitted to National Associations of Local Authorities.

This meeting will set the guidelines for a concrete roadmap presenting good practices on non-sewered sanitation, concerning local authorities.

Today, 3.6 billion people lack safely managed sanitation and more than 494 million people still practice open defecation, which is posing serious threats to public health, environment, and economic development. 
Providing adequate access to safely managed and inclusive sanitation services to more than 700 million urban dwellers is essential in making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable as envisaged by SDG 11.  Today, up to 530 cities are reporting the devastating effects of climate change as such 517 million urban residents have been directly impacted by the increased diseases and lost livelihoods, have destroyed infrastructure, and have undermined the capacity of local governments to provide basic services to their citizens. The impacts of climate change on sanitation systems, therefore, call for increased investment in climate-resilient sanitation infrastructures and systems.

CWIS is a public service approach to planning and implementing urban sanitation systems to achieve outcomes summarized by SDG 6.2. CWIS looks to shift the urban sanitation paradigm, aiming to ensure universal access to safely managed sanitation by promoting a range of solutions—both onsite and sewered, centralized or decentralized—considering the local context of the growing cities. The CWIS service framework includes a set of core service outcomes and the required system for sanitation service delivery.

Sessions Objectives 
The session will take stock of the lessons learnt from CWIS-related projects being implemented by Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), UN-Habitat, and their partner organizations.  The main objective of this session is to share the hands-on experiences and learnings on the preparation of bankable CWIS projects and the key success factors to translate the CWIS Approach into impactful actions on the ground. Mechanisms for increased collaboration between development banks and the UN (e.g., UN-Habitat) to support growth and maximize impacts of urban sanitation investments will be also discussed during this session.

Across all these partnerships, water plays a vital role for life, health, food, biodiversity, climate, societal resilience, economy and trade. However, water continues to be rated as one of the most important sectors for Africa’s growth but is still facing investment shortfalls and lacking political attention.

Drawing on this observation, the “African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want”, water security constitutes one of the priorities sought by the agenda and has the potential to unlock greater progress in terms of direct human benefits, economic benefits, and environmental benefits. This position has been reaffirmed in 2021 with AMCOW’s Windhoek Multi-Stakeholder Resolutions calling to accelerate water security and access to safely managed sanitation and hygiene in Africa. 

The session will present the central role played by water in advancing strategic partnerships between the EU and Africa to tackle emerging challenges and dovetail common priorities and interests through water.

Within the framework of the 9th World Water Forum in Dakar in March 2022, OMVS and its partners present ""Voice of the River, Path to Peace"". Aiming at engaging a dialogue between the major development axes of the Senegal River basin, the societal dynamics and the local entrepreneurship related to water, this project will conceive innovative solutions by gathering local populations and their youth, artists, personalities, experts and the basin organization. It will thus reflect on the consultation of local populations, the creation of local jobs and the role that OMVS can play in strengthening peace in the basin with the establishment of a Blue Fund to support local entrepreneurship and employment. The internationally renowned artist Baaba Maal, sponsor of the project, will be involved in facilitating dialogue with local populations.  

The project has several components, including the Open Sahel Festival; the production of an album with Baaba Maal, Daara J Family, Noumoucounda, Fatoumata Diawara, Noura Mint Seymali, and Sékou Kouyaté; community exchanges; the development of a blue fund concept; and a contest to mobilize and engage youth. All of the activities and works produced under the project will be used to bring local people's advocacy to the 9th World Water Forum in Dakar so that local voices are better considered in decision-making bodies. 

Objectives 
- To present to the WWF the results of the dialogue carried out by the ""Voices from the River, Path to Peace"" project and the solutions created through the project.
- Interact with WEF participants to exchange and generate partnerships on the concept of a Blue Fund for employment and social entrepreneurship at OMVS and other solutions identified by the project

Yet billions of people still do not enjoy these fundamental rights.
The rights to water and sanitation require that these are available, accessible, safe, acceptable and affordable for all without discrimination. These elements are clearly interrelated. While access to water may be guaranteed in theory, in reality, if it is too expensive, people do not have access. Having a tap which delivers unsafe water does not improve one’s access. Human rights demand a holistic understanding of access to water and sanitation.
The rights to water and sanitation further require an explicit focus on the most disadvantaged and marginalized, as well as an emphasis on participation, empowerment, accountability and transparency.
The promotion of human rights to drinking water and sanitation is one of the priorities of the Spanish cooperation policy. For several decades, work has been going on in two ways: the international recognition of water and sanitation as human rights, and the effective realization of these rights. The Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation for Latin America and the Caribbean is one of Spain's most ambitious instruments in this field, since it was established with the aim of making the human rights to water and sanitation (DHAS) effective, prioritizing the most fragile countries and the most vulnerable populations.
This session will address success stories in achieving the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation.

Being this as one of the main short-term objectives in the world, the impacts of climate change and the degradation of natural water sources make water security an insurmountable challenge in the medium and long term.
In this context, addressing the problems of water scarcity, pollution of water bodies, adverse effects of extreme hydrometeorological events, growing conflicts over water and environmental degradation of rivers and aquifers will address the challenges of achieving water security. 
In the face of such challenges, the promotion of unconventional resources, such as desalination and reuse, is essential to meet these challenges, not to mention the necessary improvements in regulatory and governance mechanisms, as well as properly designed water infrastructure, respecting environmental objectives and ensuring their maintenance. 
The session aims to present the main instruments for achieving water security, in terms of integrated water resources management, development and operation of environmentally compatible infrastructure, financial mechanisms and incentives. for sustainable water management, which will accelerate the path towards achieving SDG 6.
The first part is planned to make an exhibition of the world panorama, while in the second part will be exposed cases of concrete practices that can serve as inspiration to other territories.

Special Session;SS53;BRIDGING THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE GAPS IN THE WASH SECTOR;Thursday 24th of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Thursday 24th of March from 13.30 to 15.00;Room 9;USAID’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) program has been implemented since 2016 with the objective of closing financing gaps to achieve universal access to water and sanitation services through sustainable and creditworthy business models, increased public funding, and expanded market finance for infrastructure investment. The program has so far helped raise over USD 68.4 million in 8 countries in Africa and Asia, showing that it is possible to leverage private financing to the sector. However, USD 68 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the USD 114 billion per year that is estimated to be needed to bridge the sector financing gap. Using examples from the Philippines, Cambodia, and Kenya, this session will frame the WASH finance gap as a governance challenge focusing on the lack of clarity in sector actor roles and responsibilities, particularly within sectors undergoing decentralization/devolution processes. Using examples from Senegal, Mozambique and South Africa, the session will also showcase how technical assistance programs like WASH-FIN can help address water sector governance challenges to enable both the framework and financing mechanisms needed to crowd-in new sources of financing for both public and private WASH service providers. This interactive session is targeted at WASH practitioners managing and regulating water utilities, government decision makers, financiers, and academics.  By the end of the session, participants will have developed an appreciation of key sector governance challenges and how they may be addressed to enable increased access to non-traditional financing to public and private WASH service providers.;"Time	Activity	Presenters/Panelists

The Special Session will discuss the significance of material, conceptual and spiritual aspects of water-related cultural heritage. The discussion will focus on the critical relevance of world water heritage for present and future water security, and to promote peace and development. The Special Session flows from the recommendations of the 2020 Tokyo symposium on Water and Culture/Heritage which was organized by the National Institute on Policy Studies of Japan in cooperation with the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on Water and Heritage (ISCWater).  
The President of ISCWater will offer the keynote (via link) presentation, during which he will underscore the significance of world water heritage in meeting the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as a milestone leading to the 2023 UN World Water Decade Mid Term Review (MTR) in New York. We envisage that the outcomes of the High-Level Panel will offer direct inputs for the Conceptual Framework for Valuing Water and for the UN Water Decade MTR.
