Conclusion and political messages 5 mn. ;In crisis situations (conflict, disaster, epidemic), which are becoming increasingly long and complex, it is necessary to link the emergency humanitarian response to a more sustainable response as soon as the context allows it. This process, called the Humanitarian-Development Nexus, requires a good analysis of the situation, a relevant response defined with the population and the capacity to follow up over time. The Nexus implies cooperation with several types of national and international actors, complementary to each other, including the populations and their representatives in the framework of the water, sanitation and hygiene MDGs in particular. ;;1A1;Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;1A Implement the Right to Water and Sanitation and provide access to safe water and sanitation in emergency situations ;Ordinary Thematic Session;"<p>Messages clés N MIG1 (en)</p>

";The Human Right to Water is a critical component of the international rights framework, and is a necessary component of the advancement of human society and development. Coming on the heels of the 10th anniversary of the UN General Assembly's adoption of Resolution 64/292's explicit right to water and with the 20th anniversary of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' General Comment 15 recognizing the human right to water coming later this year, this panel asks: where are we now and where are we going? This wide-reaching panel will bring together voices from the forefront of these efforts, showing how the law, education, journalism, technology, and development can help drive the next two decades of action.;;1A2;Puesday 23nd of March from 36.00H to 10.33H;Puesday 23nd of March from 36.00H to 10.33H;1A Implement the Right to Water and Sanitation and provide access to safe water and sanitation in emergency situations ;Keystone Roundtable;"<p>Messages clés N MIG1 (en)</p>

Also convened in this discussion will private sector and utility representatives to highlight the contribution of technologies.;"Action Idea #3 has been divided into three projects: (1) Strengthening the enabling policy environment for safely managed sanitation; (2) Promote wide adoption of sanitation as a utility service and (3) Demonstration of emerging commercial to advance sanitation. Achieving sustainable sanitation requires combined efforts from multiple partners. Sessions under this action idea shall convene government stakeholders, regulators, private sector, and civil society actors. Government and regulators will be guided to embrace inclusive sanitation as a utility service through the showcasing of how advances in inclusive sanitation technology and commercial opportunities from CWIS pilots materialize sanitation policies. Participating decision makers, private sector, civil society organizations actors and communities will understand how inclusive sanitation policies contribute to the creation of a well-regulated environment for safely managed sanitation.

";Water is an essential constituent for humans, and for life. Polluted water is often identified as the main vector to infectious pathogens, toxins and organic contaminants, which can be associated with a large number of chronic diseases worldwide. In the past decades, growth of human population and human activities have not only increased the quantity of waste discharged into water bodies, but also introduced emerging substances, including pollutants of industrial source, pharmaceuticals or micro plastics. ;;1B1;Tuesday 22nd of March from 10.45H to 12.15H;Tuesday 22nd of March from 10.45H to 12.15H;1R Implement the Right to Water and Sanitation and provide access to safe water and sanitation in emergency situations,1K  Improve water quality and waste management;Ordinary Thematic Session2;"<p>Messages clés N MIG1 (en)</p>

Closing the session with short summary/reflection/remarks (about 10 minutes) 
";"•	The need for solutions in managing water resources is obvious and strong from local to global context, which is vital to tackle emerging water security challenges caused by population growth and climate change. 

•	Nature-based solutions can play an important role in improving the supply and quality of water and reducing the impact of natural disasters. ‘Green’ infrastructure, as opposed to traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure, focuses on preserving the functions of ecosystems, both natural and built, and environmental engineering rather than civil engineering to improve the quality of water. 

•	The projects gathered under action 3 will concentrate on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure: how they can improve the quality of water and resources. Action 3 will show in many ways how impactful those solutions can be in project management, both in wastewater treatment and for ecosystems.

";The response to meeting the need for sanitation systems is limited by their adaptability and may not meet environmental sustainability requirements. Many solutions are being shared around the world to address this situation, despite the intensity of the advocacy. Communities are eager to see, at long last, this conundrum properly addressed. During this World Water Forum, several answers including, among others expected at this World Water Forum, the best technologies responding to the site constraints will be made available by the world's experts.;;MIG7;Tuesday 22nd of March from 9.00H to 10.30H;Tuesday 22nd of March from 9.00H to 10.30H;1B  Improve water quality and waste managemen;Ordinary Thematic Session;"<p>Messages clés N MIG1 (en)</p>

2.	Presentation on key messages and calls to action made in the WHO and UNICEF’s State of the World’s Hand Hygiene report – Kelly-Ann Naylor, UNICEF  
3.	Panel of 3-5 government and civil society representatives to showcase examples of the five key ‘accelerators’ identified in the report and underpinning the UN-Water SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework. Panellists will be prompted by a Chair to provide 5-minute interventions sharing their experiences of improving governance, financing, capacity, data and information or innovation to improve hand hygiene:
a.	On GOVERNANCE - Deputy Director of Environmental Health for South Africa (TBC). Describing how the country’s national handwashing policy, developed in 2015, clearly spelt out the roles of government institutions in promoting handwashing and providing services, and was instrumental in enabling the country to seamlessly mount a large-scale COVID-19 response effort.
b.	On FINANCE - Gov of Ethiopia representative. Describing recent efforts to develop a costed country roadmap for hand hygiene and plans for financing it 
c.	On CAPACITY – WASH ‘Em/COVID-19 Hygiene Hub representation – describing capacity needs of the service users, how these were met during the pandemic and what lessons we can learn for future outbreak response
d.	On … - GTFCC representation. Speaking on the experience of implementing GTFCC roadmap in countries. 
e.	On INNOVATION – Gov of Indonesia representative. Describing Indonesia’s COVID-19 innovative monitoring system, developed by the government with support from UNICEF, tracked compliance with the national “3M” mandate to wear masks, socially distance and practice hand hygiene in schools, shopping centres, mosques and transport stations. The system was remarkable in its scale. Initially led by the Office of the President, it engaged the army, CSOs and celebrities, and was administered by volunteers, trained via WhatsApp, using smartphones to collect data. Rather than being paid, volunteers were rewarded with mobile phone credit. The system provided a trustworthy source of data, based on structured observation, rather than less accurate self-reporting.
