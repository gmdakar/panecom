Building off of the past and creating a vision for the future will also demand a great deal of education, advocacy, technology, law, journalism and other efforts before and after the Forum, and we will be developing follow-on partnerships to deliver this during the period. 

The Forum is a chance to harness great hope, a reemerging world looking to solve problems, and a population who knows—now more than ever—how important water is. By staking a clear claim and setting a clear path for water, we believe that we can set the course for water for the next two decades. (fr)"
