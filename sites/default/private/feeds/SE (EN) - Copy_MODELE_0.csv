In addition, mangroves provide essential services for the livelihoods of coastal communities. The session will revisit the role that mangroves can play in coastal protection in West Africa and the importance of effective management of these ecosystems. Through different presentations, the conditions for the preservation of this mangrove ecosystem will be illustrated and discussed. The session will answer the following question: What are the conditions necessary to ensure an effective role of mangroves in the protection of the coast in West Africa. This should allow to formulate some strong recommendations that can feed the results of the forum.

The Great Green Wall Initiative was created in response to this contact with the vision of restoring the viability of the natural capital and productive systems of the Sahelian lands and transforming them into areas of economic prosperity that are perfectly integrated into the economic fabric of the countries. The Initiative integrates the three paradigms of Restoration / Development / Security. The major challenge is the control of water resources, which necessarily implies more efficient management of this vital resource, a limiting factor in any development. The GGW countries are above the water stress threshold. A study made by the OSS in 2021 indicates that the water potential is significant with regard to the surface area of each aquifer system but is little mobilized and under-exploited. This issue deserves a high-level debate in order to obtain significant guidance as it is a key issue. The main objectives of the Side Event are to discuss the water issue in the Sahelian region and in particular in the context of the GGW. The panelists, who are high-level international experts, will address the key issues related to this resource for the Sahel and will outline the best perspectives in terms of its strategic importance, control and management, mechanisms for mobilizing potential financial resources, and possible improvements to national policies.;60';As an indication, Prof. Boubacar Barry of the 9thFME, Nabil Ben Khatra Executive Secretary of the OSS, Dr. Abdelkader Dodo of the OSS, Geoffroy Citegeste of Birdlife international, ;

Un cadre sectoriel favorable aux niveaux politique, institutionnel et réglementaire et des services d'eau et d'assainissement performants jouent tous un rôle essentiel dans la réalisation de la sécurité mondiale de l'eau. Pour de nombreuses sociétés d'eau dans le monde, la réalité actuelle est constituée de réglementations dysfonctionnelles et de niveaux de tarification insuffisants qui perpétuent un équilibre de faible niveau de performance. Le développement du secteur de l'eau lui-même et le développement des entreprises de services publics peuvent bénéficier de mécanismes de financement innovants, au-delà du financement des infrastructures par projet provenant des donateurs. Le financement lié à des incitations concrètes au changement est une occasion d'accélérer les réformes dans le secteur de l'eau et le redressement des opérations des services publics.
L'objectif de cette session est de partager des expériences et de recueillir des commentaires sur les mécanismes de financement innovants qui répondent aux défis mentionnés ci-dessus : Les prêts basés sur les politiques (PBL), le financement basé sur les résultats (RBF) et le financement d'entreprise pour les services d'eau et d'assainissement ("" financement opérationnel "").

This growth creates many challenges for making cities sustainable and requires collective intelligence and action for water and environmental security. Urban growth can be an opportunity for economic development however as natural resources are limited; it is also a threat to the quality of life.

There is already a focus on sustainable cities through frameworks such as the Principles for Water Wise Cities , which emphasis the need to optimize  costs, resilience of water resources, conservation of biodiversity, etc. This includes collaborative actions to reconcile the urban water cycle with the wider water cycle which includes river and lake basins and aquifers which cities rely on for their water resources. All stakeholders must be involved in identifying and implementing appropriate and sustainable solutions for effective city-basin governance.

The International Water Association (IWA) and the International Network of Basin Organizations (INBO) are designing a handbook, a decision-making tool to strengthen the city's connection and integration with its hydrographic basin. This handbook expands on the Action Agenda for Basin-Connected Cities which reflects the current and potential issues between cities and their basins and how to deal with them by identifying the drivers for action (e.g. what are the risks?), and the possible solution pathways.  Through practical case studies, testimonials and recommendations, the handbook will illustrate how the ""urban actor"" can and must play an active role in the protection of water resources and in the reconnection of basins to their cities.

During this event INBO and IWA will outline the ambition of the handbook which targets both policy makers and technicians, and which will also aims to raise awareness among civil society and environmental groups.";60';"Eric TARDIEU, INBO Secretary General

Regional Cooperation to 
defuse tensions and 
share prosperity";Transboundary water | Regional Cooperation-Economic Development;"After decades of gloomy foresights and discourse on water wars and conflicts, it turns out that water wars are more a media narrative than a possible future in transboundary waters. Connecting nations socio-economic’ joint interests through cross borders development mega-projects is a leeway to shared prosperity. Water in shared basins is a real development connector. It takes political will to make the nations upstream and downstream real shareholders in dialogue and cooperation aligned with WWF9 motto, water for peace and development. It starts with re-centering the debate by valuing the benefits of cooperation on shared rivers benefits while defusing roots causes of tension and de-politicizing (or at least by reducing the politicization) of the discourse on shared water.  
The present session is a remarkable opportunity to showcase three lab cases to illustrate the potential of regional development cooperation in transboundary water: The navigation project feasibility from source to sea in the Nile River and the energy security across borders in Senegal River Basin and in Central Asia.   

Objectives : 
•	Sharing experiences on the potential of development cooperation in transboundary rivers in concrete examples. 
•	Identify the keys framework conditions for successful joint projects, in navigation and energy security, in 3 shared basins in Africa and Asia  
•	Debate on drivers of success in shared economic development and lessons learned from the three experiences.
•	Elaborate a set of guiding principles to turn risks of tension into cooperation opportunities and shift from water rights to shared right to development and prosperity.
•	Assess the limitations and potential benefits of hydro-diplomacy in trust building between upstream and downstream nations 

The session intends to answer the following questions: 
•	What should come first, political will or economic benefits in order to turn risks of tensions into opportunities for regional development?
•	What are the key drivers of success in making water a connector between nations in the three basins? 
•	What principles could guide countries to opt for joint large projects instead of disagreement on water shares.
Expected outcomes:
•	Global understanding of shared water as a driver of socio-economic development, peace and cooperation between upstream and downstream countries
•	Set the key principles guiding regional economic cooperation in shared basins";60';"?	Moderator Ambassdor Shahira Wahbi LAS

In northern countries, which have been confronted with these proliferations for more than 40 years, monitoring of these microorganisms has been set up and actions have been undertaken to (i) limit the dangers for human populations and (ii) fight against these phenomena. In sub-Saharan Africa, this issue is still largely ignored by managers and users of water bodies. Based on the results of an international research program (WaSAf) that focused on three African water bodies used to supply large cities (Abidjan, Dakar and Kampala), the proposed side event will aim to stimulate dialogue and exchanges between scientists, managers and decision-makers on the causes and consequences of cyanobacteria blooms and on the monitoring and management of these phenomena. It will be based on two round tables that will be introduced by short presentations made by the researchers involved in Wasaf, before giving the floor to the audience. The first panel will focus on the vulnerability of water bodies to cyanobacterial blooms and the implementation of cyanobacterial monitoring programs, and the second will focus on the management of cyanobacterial hazards and the control of cyanobacterial blooms. ;60';Speakers: Cécile Bernard (MNHN Paris, France), Catherine Quiblier (University of Paris, France), Youssoupha Tall (IRD Senegal), Mark Olokotum (Nafirri, Uganda), Moderators: Marc Trousselier (CNRS Montpellier) & JF Humbert (INRAE, France);Two 30-minute round tables.

It was welcomed by all stakeholders, as it corresponds to the magnitude of the social, economic and environmental challenges of the Sahel.
In an introductory presentation, the CILSS, mandated by the countries, will explain how the ""Dakar Declaration"" on irrigation was translated into a regional investment program based on a consensual and critical document on the situation of agricultural water management in the Sahel, the Strategic Framework for Agricultural Water in the Sahel (SFAS). The CSEAS developed by the actors in the formulation of the Regional Support Project to the Sahel Irrigation Initiative (PARIIS) is a synthetic document of orientation and shared vision defining the guiding principles for the conduct of irrigation programs in the Sahel and in West Africa. It posed fundamental questions on the constraints and difficulties related to the development of irrigation in the Sahelian zone and in West Africa. CSEAS is recognized by stakeholders as an institutional memory that provides a solid structural foundation for current and future investments. 
In light of and based on the implementation of PARIIS and the results currently obtained in the 6 countries and at the regional level led by the CILSS, the session will seek through crossed points of view (States, regional technical and political structures, Financial Partners, Producers) to question the decision makers and the actors of agricultural water on the following questions
1) Are the actors capable of making the necessary paradigm shift and implementing the transformational approach required to stimulate the development of irrigation in the Sahel?
2) What are the practical modalities for strengthening the commitment of producers who are placed at the heart of the investment in this initiative?
3) What are the priorities on which to focus efforts to consolidate the results on the ground of this initiative based on the irrigation solution? 
4) What concrete actions should be implemented to scale up efforts and increase funding, with a view to moving decisively towards the objectives of the Dakar Declaration?   

To this end, we will focus on the Regional Support Project for the Sahel Irrigation Initiative (PARIIS), which is currently being implemented and which constitutes a lever for the realization of this ambitious program. The ambition of this project is to create the necessary conditions for the development and scaling up of irrigation solutions in the Sahel and West African countries. 
The PARIIS results that will be presented indicate the need to continue and consolidate the process of documenting and implementing viable investment models, which are beginning to prove themselves in the field. This process should result in a range of ""irrigation solutions"" adapted to different types of irrigation systems, to improve current and future investments. The ambition is to create a training effect and to go to scale in the Sahel and West African countries. 
The Panel is a moment of reflection on the key issues raised. ";60';"Moderator: ECOWAS Director of Agriculture

Each year more than 32 billion cubic meters of treated water are lost due to leaks in the distribution system. In addition, 16 billion cubic meter per year are supplied to customers without being billed, due to theft, faulty meters or corruption. An estimate of the total annual cost of these losses to water companies worldwide is US$14 billion. These losses would represent 50% to 60% of the water supplied, compared to the world average of 35%. Saving this amount would provide water to an additional 100 million people without any additional investment. 
In many African countries, NRW often reaches such high proportions that it significantly compromises the financial viability of companies by reducing their capacity to serve the population. Also, NRW increases human pressure on the environment, particularly by encouraging the over-exploitation of freshwater resources. 
Through the Water Operators' Partnerships (WOP) approach as a peer-to-peer learning process, AfWA has proven its effectiveness to address identifying challenges and improving operator performance to accelerate progress towards the MDGs in water and sanitation services.

In other words, we seek to explain how the deficit of water resources in forests could affect the mitigation capacity of forests to climate change. Indeed, trees and forests, in general, sequester greenhouse gases, particularly atmospheric CO2, and contribute to the fight against climate change. This important ability of forests remains functional thanks to the mechanism of photosynthesis which is strongly dependent on the availability of water. Ultimately, forests are qualified as carbon sinks insofar as they store millions of tons of carbon. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), forest ecosystems remain the second largest carbon reservoir after the oceans.  They are so, remain so and would certainly remain so if the cycle and availability of water were not unbalanced or disturbed, hence the quintessence of the implementation of an effective policy of management and conservation of water resources in forest environments.;60';;
