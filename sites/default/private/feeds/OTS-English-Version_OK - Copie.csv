Building off of the past and creating a vision for the future will also demand a great deal of education, advocacy, technology, law, journalism and other efforts before and after the Forum, and we will be developing follow-on partnerships to deliver this during the period. 

The Forum is a chance to harness great hope, a reemerging world looking to solve problems, and a population who knows—now more than ever—how important water is. By staking a clear claim and setting a clear path for water, we believe that we can set the course for water for the next two decades."

•	Nature-based solutions can play an important role in improving the supply and quality of water and reducing the impact of natural disasters. ‘Green’ infrastructure, as opposed to traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure, focuses on preserving the functions of ecosystems, both natural and built, and environmental engineering rather than civil engineering to improve the quality of water. 

•	The projects gathered under action 3 will concentrate on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure: how they can improve the quality of water and resources. Action 3 will show in many ways how impactful those solutions can be in project management, both in wastewater treatment and for ecosystems.

Panellists will be prompted by a Chair to provide 5-minute interventions sharing their experiences of improving governance, financing, capacity, data and information or innovation to improve hand hygiene:
a.	On GOVERNANCE - Deputy Director of Environmental Health for South Africa (TBC). Describing how the country’s national handwashing policy, developed in 2015, clearly spelt out the roles of government institutions in promoting handwashing and providing services, and was instrumental in enabling the country to seamlessly mount a large-scale COVID-19 response effort.
b.	On FINANCE - Gov of Ethiopia representative. Describing recent efforts to develop a costed country roadmap for hand hygiene and plans for financing it 
c.	On CAPACITY – WASH ‘Em/COVID-19 Hygiene Hub representation – describing capacity needs of the service users, how these were met during the pandemic and what lessons we can learn for future outbreak response
d.	On … - GTFCC representation. Speaking on the experience of implementing GTFCC roadmap in countries. 
e.	On INNOVATION – Gov of Indonesia representative. Describing Indonesia’s COVID-19 innovative monitoring system, developed by the government with support from UNICEF, tracked compliance with the national “3M” mandate to wear masks, socially distance and practice hand hygiene in schools, shopping centres, mosques and transport stations. The system was remarkable in its scale. Initially led by the Office of the President, it engaged the army, CSOs and celebrities, and was administered by volunteers, trained via WhatsApp, using smartphones to collect data. Rather than being paid, volunteers were rewarded with mobile phone credit. The system provided a trustworthy source of data, based on structured observation, rather than less accurate self-reporting.

•	Policies that improve ecosystems to combat desertification and achieve drought resilience are implemented and enforced.
•	Economic and environmental policy development that considers the interlinkages between terrestrial, freshwater, delta, coastal, nearshore and ocean ecosystems and addresses source-to-sea systems.
•	Water quality is improved through cooperation on management of the land-water interface and strengthening governance of shared resources through sharing knowledge.
•	A holistic, integrated approach to managing inland freshwater resources, their basins and their ecosystem services, focusing on improved governance actions considering the mixture of complex scientific/management challenges associated with the interlinkages/ interactions between the lentic and lotic water systems typically comprising a freshwater drainage basin is implemented on a global scale
•	Improvement of inland water system governance on a basin scale, including development of relevant training regarding institutional capabilities, policy development and application, technological/non-technological options, monitoring needs, encouragement of public participation, and ensuring sustained and adequate funding is available for such purposes, is undertaken at regional, national and local levels, as appropriate
•	The environment of Hann Bay will eventually be restored on the sanitary, economic and social levels. The fishing and tourism activities in particular, strongly impacted by the degradation of the bay, will be able to benefit from the positive effects of the collection and treatment of effluents, thus reducing the poverty rate. The population concerned by this project is estimated at 390,000 people spread over 5 municipalities. In 2026, the population concerned should reach 450,000 people.
•	Activities will reconcile income-generating activities of communities and ecosystem management. This will allow for the achievement of results to assess the contribution of communities/populations to sustainable development.
•	Provide a response to the problems faced by coastal areas affected by climate change and  also a policy of adaptation and mitigation to the effects of climate change.

Collecting (or modeling), analyzing, and communicating this information is vital for both monitoring (e.g., SDGs) and decision making, but the resources for data acquisition and knowledge management are insufficient, and data providers and decision makers are not working closely as they could. 
This session focuses on bridging these “gaps” by promoting: 1) modern methods and tools that provide or synthesize relevant data for ecosystem-based management and 2) networks to share experience and skill transfer to build capacity in decision-support. It will feature innovative approaches, such as using remote sensing as a complement to in-situ monitoring, and will also highlight examples from around the world where data is being transformed into knowledge and to help decision/policy makers better incorporate ecosystem protection into water resource management

As climate change impacts increase, a massive financial effort is required to improve water resources management, develop (green and grey) water infrastructures and boost adaptation.

Yet, in the portfolio of projects supported by climate finance actors, water is not well represented, lagging far behind the sectors of energy, agriculture or forestry. Part of the problem still is a lack of awareness from donors that adaptation of these sectors (cooling power plants, irrigating crops, limiting deforestation and desertification) requires water. And maintaining a strong communication and advocacy effort is part of the solution. 

But the heart of the problem seems to lie both in the complexity of the climate finance landscape and in the limited capacities of water stakeholders to achieve a cycle of climate project preparation and to access donors’ preparation facilities. 

There is a necessity to build their capacities to prepare well-designed, bankable climate resilient water projects that will attract funding from the wide range of private and public donors of climate finance!

";Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;Room 9;"The precariousness of hygiene and sanitation services in rural areas around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is striking, especially in Africa where 77% of the population lacks basic sanitation. The implementation of participatory governance is key to meeting this challenge and considering the whole sanitation chain. The approach allows to associate all stakeholders (users, communities, government services, technical and financial partners etc.) to contribute to the elaboration of national strategies, to translate these strategies into concrete actions at the local level by responding to the best expectations and the context considered, but also to ensure the necessary monitoring of the service implemented and how it meets the expectations of users. It is also an opportunity to recall the roles and responsibilities of key players at all levels but above all to appreciate the level of involvement of each party.
This session will allow to share successful experiences and to draw lessons for their consideration by the greatest number.

La précarité des services d’hygiène et d’assainissement en milieu rural dans le monde surtout dans les pays à faible et moyen revenu est saisissante, tout particulièrement en Afrique où 77% de la population n’a pas d’assainissement basique. La mise en place d’une gouvernance participative est clé pour relever ce défi et considérer l’ensemble de la filière assainissement. La démarche permet ainsi d’associer l’ensemble des parties prenantes (usagers, collectivités, services de l’Etat, partenaires techniques et financiers etc.) pour contribuer à l’élaboration des stratégies nationales, pour traduire ces stratégies en actions concrètes au niveau local en répondant au mieux attentes et au contexte considéré, mais aussi pour assurer le nécessaire suivi du service mis en place et comment il répond aux attentes des usagers. C`est aussi l`occasion de rappelerles rôles et responsabilités des acteurs clé à tous les niveaux mais surtout apprécier le niveau d`implication de chaque partie .
Cette session permettra de partager les expériences réussies, les outils et méthodes mis en œuvre et d’en tirer des leçons pour leur prise en compte par le plus grand nombre.

";Tuesday 22nd of March from 13.30H to 15.00H;Tuesday 22nd of March from 13.30H to 15.00H;Room 3;"Individual sanitation, especially in rural areas, is often the poorest part of national sanitation policies. While public money largely subsidises urban master plans and collective infrastructures, individual sanitation, by nature on the private domain, is the sole responsibility of households. The latter, when they are aware of the problem, find themselves having to manage the financing, design, construction and maintenance of their infrastructures and the management of its by-products. What approaches can be used today to make households aware of the importance of sanitation, and to build up/dynamise the sector in rural areas so that everyone finds competent partners to help them build a sanitation system adapted to their needs and constraints?      

L’assainissement individuel, encore plus en zone rurale est souvent le parent pauvre des politiques nationales d’assainissement. Alors que l’argent public subventionne largement les schémas directeurs urbains et les infrastructures collectives, l’assainissement individuel, par nature sur le domaine privé relève du seul ressort des ménages. Ces derniers, lorsqu’ils ont conscience du problème, se retrouvent à devoir gérer le financement, la conception, la réalisation et l’entretien de leurs infrastructures et de ses sous-produits. Quelles approches permettent aujourd’hui de sensibiliser les ménages à l’importance de l’assainissement, et de construire/dynamiser le secteur en zone rurale pour que chacun trouve des partenaires compétents pour l’aider à construire un assainissement adapté à ses besoins et à ses contraintes ?

";TAE, Productive water, Circular economy, Soil resources, Food/Energy/Health nexus;"Objective : Disseminate better agroecological techniques as technical means of saving profitable water and profitable soils for agricultural production.

Description and purpose : In rural areas, access to water is often difficult. Also improving the productivity of water is a major challenge. Agroecological techniques make it possible to rationalize the use of water for green production, using plant associations and / or agroforestry to use soil ecosystem services (soil moisture, soil living…).

This item is dealing with the use of the agroecological transition to save water and soil for farmers’ enrichment. We propose 6 examples:

";"I – Assessment – How far are we from effectively financing the water and sanitation sector? 20 min
GLAAS & TrackFin – 10 min Didier Allely

Effective financing for drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is essential to deliver and sustain services. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) results indicate that there are substantial gaps in our understanding and tracking of financing to the WASH sector. Financial reporting is often insufficient to make sound and evidence-based planning and budgeting decisions. To help address the issue, WHO is supporting national government to develop WASH accounts using the TrackFin methodology under the UN-Water GLAAS project. GLAAS reports assess data from several different sources, including global data on sanitation and drinking-water coverage, donor aid flows, economic and development indicators, health indicator data, and data from regional sector and multi-sector assessments. GLAAS gathers data at both recipient country and external support agency level to fill key knowledge gaps 
Objectives:
•	Highlight current financial information at the national level from GLAAS and WASH accounts implementing countries
•	Highlight results from the External Support Agency survey
•	 10 min discussion with the audience
II – Of the need for more engagement: PDBs leveraging private and public stakeholders – 30 min 
•	AFD Céline Robert – Co Chair of the Water Finance Coalition – 15 min
Introduce the rationale of the Water Finance Coalition and the necessity for PBDs to engage and work on those challenges, as well as how PDBs can help leveraging both private and public stakeholders. 
+ Take aways from the global study on PDBs : Some constraints have to be addressed for NDBs to succeed in financing water and sanitation: demand and offer of financing do not meet spontaneously. National Development Banks need specific financial tools (such as project preparation funds) and dedicated skills/expertise to be able to invest in the wash sector.
