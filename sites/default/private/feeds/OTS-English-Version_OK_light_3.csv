This process, called the Humanitarian-Development Nexus, requires a good analysis of the situation, a relevant response defined with the population and the capacity to follow up over time. The Nexus implies cooperation with several types of national and international actors, complementary to each other, including the populations and their representatives in the framework of the water, sanitation and hygiene MDGs in particular. ;Introduction moderator 3 mn, video 5 mn, state of play of the crises and key figures in relation to MDG 6 5mn, water and health 5 mn, emergency response 5 mn, nexus Burkina Faso 10 mn, questions-answers and debate with the public 15mn, round table on financing 5mn, coordination of actors 5mn, questions-answers and debate with the public 15mn.

Building off of the past and creating a vision for the future will also demand a great deal of education, advocacy, technology, law, journalism and other efforts before and after the Forum, and we will be developing follow-on partnerships to deliver this during the period. 

The Forum is a chance to harness great hope, a reemerging world looking to solve problems, and a population who knows—now more than ever—how important water is. By staking a clear claim and setting a clear path for water, we believe that we can set the course for water for the next two decades."

Panellists will be prompted by a Chair to provide 5-minute interventions sharing their experiences of improving governance, financing, capacity, data and information or innovation to improve hand hygiene:
a.	On GOVERNANCE - Deputy Director of Environmental Health for South Africa (TBC). Describing how the country’s national handwashing policy, developed in 2015, clearly spelt out the roles of government institutions in promoting handwashing and providing services, and was instrumental in enabling the country to seamlessly mount a large-scale COVID-19 response effort.
b.	On FINANCE - Gov of Ethiopia representative. Describing recent efforts to develop a costed country roadmap for hand hygiene and plans for financing it 
c.	On CAPACITY – WASH ‘Em/COVID-19 Hygiene Hub representation – describing capacity needs of the service users, how these were met during the pandemic and what lessons we can learn for future outbreak response
d.	On … - GTFCC representation. Speaking on the experience of implementing GTFCC roadmap in countries. 
e.	On INNOVATION – Gov of Indonesia representative. Describing Indonesia’s COVID-19 innovative monitoring system, developed by the government with support from UNICEF, tracked compliance with the national “3M” mandate to wear masks, socially distance and practice hand hygiene in schools, shopping centres, mosques and transport stations. The system was remarkable in its scale. Initially led by the Office of the President, it engaged the army, CSOs and celebrities, and was administered by volunteers, trained via WhatsApp, using smartphones to collect data. Rather than being paid, volunteers were rewarded with mobile phone credit. The system provided a trustworthy source of data, based on structured observation, rather than less accurate self-reporting.

•	Policies that improve ecosystems to combat desertification and achieve drought resilience are implemented and enforced.
•	Economic and environmental policy development that considers the interlinkages between terrestrial, freshwater, delta, coastal, nearshore and ocean ecosystems and addresses source-to-sea systems.
•	Water quality is improved through cooperation on management of the land-water interface and strengthening governance of shared resources through sharing knowledge.
•	A holistic, integrated approach to managing inland freshwater resources, their basins and their ecosystem services, focusing on improved governance actions considering the mixture of complex scientific/management challenges associated with the interlinkages/ interactions between the lentic and lotic water systems typically comprising a freshwater drainage basin is implemented on a global scale
•	Improvement of inland water system governance on a basin scale, including development of relevant training regarding institutional capabilities, policy development and application, technological/non-technological options, monitoring needs, encouragement of public participation, and ensuring sustained and adequate funding is available for such purposes, is undertaken at regional, national and local levels, as appropriate
•	The environment of Hann Bay will eventually be restored on the sanitary, economic and social levels. The fishing and tourism activities in particular, strongly impacted by the degradation of the bay, will be able to benefit from the positive effects of the collection and treatment of effluents, thus reducing the poverty rate. The population concerned by this project is estimated at 390,000 people spread over 5 municipalities. In 2026, the population concerned should reach 450,000 people.
•	Activities will reconcile income-generating activities of communities and ecosystem management. This will allow for the achievement of results to assess the contribution of communities/populations to sustainable development.
•	Provide a response to the problems faced by coastal areas affected by climate change and  also a policy of adaptation and mitigation to the effects of climate change.

Collecting (or modeling), analyzing, and communicating this information is vital for both monitoring (e.g., SDGs) and decision making, but the resources for data acquisition and knowledge management are insufficient, and data providers and decision makers are not working closely as they could. 
This session focuses on bridging these “gaps” by promoting: 1) modern methods and tools that provide or synthesize relevant data for ecosystem-based management and 2) networks to share experience and skill transfer to build capacity in decision-support. It will feature innovative approaches, such as using remote sensing as a complement to in-situ monitoring, and will also highlight examples from around the world where data is being transformed into knowledge and to help decision/policy makers better incorporate ecosystem protection into water resource management
