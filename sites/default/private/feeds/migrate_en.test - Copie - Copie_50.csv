Conclusion and political messages 5 mn. ;In crisis situations (conflict, disaster, epidemic), which are becoming increasingly long and complex, it is necessary to link the emergency humanitarian response to a more sustainable response as soon as the context allows it. This process, called the Humanitarian-Development Nexus, requires a good analysis of the situation, a relevant response defined with the population and the capacity to follow up over time. The Nexus implies cooperation with several types of national and international actors, complementary to each other, including the populations and their representatives in the framework of the water, sanitation and hygiene MDGs in particular. ;;1A1;Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;Monday 21st of March from 14.00H to 15.30H;1A Implement the Right to Water and Sanitation and provide access to safe water and sanitation in emergency situations ;Ordinary Thematic Session;"<p>Messages clés N MIG1 (en)</p>

";"We believe that the session can be a springboard for fundamental changes in governance for the sector, and can provide a roadmap for organizations, governments, citizens and journalists to better harmonize and protect water and water access in their countries.  Building off of the past and creating a vision for the future will also demand a great deal of education, advocacy, technology, law, journalism and other efforts before and after the Forum, and we will be developing follow-on partnerships to deliver this during the period. 

The Forum is a chance to harness great hope, a reemerging world looking to solve problems, and a population who knows—now more than ever—how important water is. By staking a clear claim and setting a clear path for water, we believe that we can set the course for water for the next two decades.";Room 1;90'

Closing the session with short summary/reflection/remarks (about 10 minutes) 
";"•	The need for solutions in managing water resources is obvious and strong from local to global context, which is vital to tackle emerging water security challenges caused by population growth and climate change. 

•	Nature-based solutions can play an important role in improving the supply and quality of water and reducing the impact of natural disasters. ‘Green’ infrastructure, as opposed to traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure, focuses on preserving the functions of ecosystems, both natural and built, and environmental engineering rather than civil engineering to improve the quality of water. 

•	The projects gathered under action 3 will concentrate on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure: how they can improve the quality of water and resources. Action 3 will show in many ways how impactful those solutions can be in project management, both in wastewater treatment and for ecosystems.

By sharing country experiences and lessons the desired outcome is a stimulating discussion on opportunities and challenges ahead.

Panel of 3-5 government and civil society representatives to showcase examples of the five key ‘accelerators’ identified in the report and underpinning the UN-Water SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework. Panellists will be prompted by a Chair to provide 5-minute interventions sharing their experiences of improving governance, financing, capacity, data and information or innovation to improve hand hygiene:
a.	On GOVERNANCE - Deputy Director of Environmental Health for South Africa (TBC). Describing how the country’s national handwashing policy, developed in 2015, clearly spelt out the roles of government institutions in promoting handwashing and providing services, and was instrumental in enabling the country to seamlessly mount a large-scale COVID-19 response effort.
b.	On FINANCE - Gov of Ethiopia representative. Describing recent efforts to develop a costed country roadmap for hand hygiene and plans for financing it 
c.	On CAPACITY – WASH ‘Em/COVID-19 Hygiene Hub representation – describing capacity needs of the service users, how these were met during the pandemic and what lessons we can learn for future outbreak response
d.	On … - GTFCC representation. Speaking on the experience of implementing GTFCC roadmap in countries. 
e.	On INNOVATION – Gov of Indonesia representative. Describing Indonesia’s COVID-19 innovative monitoring system, developed by the government with support from UNICEF, tracked compliance with the national “3M” mandate to wear masks, socially distance and practice hand hygiene in schools, shopping centres, mosques and transport stations. The system was remarkable in its scale. Initially led by the Office of the President, it engaged the army, CSOs and celebrities, and was administered by volunteers, trained via WhatsApp, using smartphones to collect data. Rather than being paid, volunteers were rewarded with mobile phone credit. The system provided a trustworthy source of data, based on structured observation, rather than less accurate self-reporting.
